Because of its location in the East China Sea, Ryukyu developed a unique culture and maritime empire through active trade with China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The kingdom maintained a tributary relationship with China before it was invaded by Satsuma of Japan in 1609. From then on, Ryukyu had a three-pronged political status: tributary state, vassal and kingdom. This lasted until 1879 when Japan formally annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom, dissolved its monarchy, and incorporated the islands as the Okinawa Prefecture. This marked the beginning of assimilation policies and erasure of Ryukyuan identity into the 20th century.</p><h2 id="Meiji-Restoration-and-Assimilation-Into-和">Meiji Restoration and Assimilation Into 和</h2><p>As laid out in the History of the Ryukyu Kingdom Timeline page,<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="The timeline will be released in early July 2025." id="fnref:5">5</a> Commodore Matthew Perry and the U.S. Navy arrived in Japan in 1853 with warships in order to force it to open itself to foreign trade. This came after the United States settled on the western coastline after the Mexican-American war, because it set its sights on Japan as a fueling site for merchant ships. After signing treaties with the United States and other Western Powers, Japan’s closed country policy ended.</p><p>After the arrival of the United States, Japan adopted Western institutions and structures to modernize and protect itself. Power was consolidated under the Meiji Emperor and Edo, which was then renamed to Tokyo. The Meiji Constitution and its two-house government was modeled after the Prussian and British parliamentary systems. Western experts were invited to Japan to teach architecture, medical science, law, economics, natural sciences, engineering and more. Japan built factories for textiles, steel, ships, and munitions. This period of time was called the Meiji Restoration.</p><p>To expand its imperial reach, Japan developed two strategies: making a modern military and creating a unifying national identity.</p><h3 id="Building-a-Strong-Military">Building a Strong Military</h3><p>富国強兵 (fukoku kyohei, &quot;rich country, strong military&quot;) became the guiding principle of national policy. Economic strength meant developing modern industries, infrastructure, and self-sufficiency. Military strength meant making a powerful, modern army to protect Japan and raise its world power status.</p><p>After the Meiji Government consolidated power, it abolished feudal lords and the samurai class. It restructured the military with Western-style ranks, uniforms, industrialization, and training. Mandatory conscriptions were established. Military academies were established, and trained officers taught based on Western military foundations. This allowed Japan to build a professional, modern military and navy.</p><div class="facts-container"><div class="flip-card" onclick='this.classList.toggle("flipped")'><div class="flip-card-inner"><div class="flip-card-front"><div class="tag">Historical Context</div><div class="title">Neighboring Territories</div><div class="subtitle"></div></div><div class="flip-card-back"><b>Imperialism in Neighboring Territories</b><p>Other territories like Taiwan, Hokkaido and Korea offered the same strategic and economic gains for Japan as Ryukyu.

The original character 倭 (wa, submissive, dwarf) was derogatory. In the 8th century, Japan replaced the character 倭 with a new one to redefine its image: 和 (wa, harmony, peace). 和 (wa) is used in words associated with traditional Japanese culture, like 和風 (wafu, Japanese-style), 和食 (washoku, Japanese cuisine), and 和服 (wafuku, Japanese clothing).</p><div class="facts-container"><div class="flip-card" onclick='this.classList.toggle("flipped")'><div class="flip-card-inner"><div class="flip-card-front"><div class="tag">Historical Context</div><div class="title">Kokutai 国体</div><div class="subtitle"></div></div><div class="flip-card-back"><b>National Essence: Kokutai 国体</b><p>To unify regional identities into one national culture, the Meiji government worked to construct a singular national identity.

This same identity was used to justify the assimilation of minority groups, often at the cost of their own cultures and traditions.</p><p>In the years after the Black Ships came, Japan’s primary motivation for annexing Ryukyu was to secure its southern borders. The Ryukyu Islands’ position south of Japan made it a potential target for Western powers: if they settled in Ryukyu, they would have easy access to the Japanese mainland. Despite protests from the Chinese, Ryukyuans and even others within the Japanese administration, Ryukyu was formally annexed into Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. This annexation and the policies that followed are also known as the Ryukyu Disposition.</p><div class="facts-container"><div class="flip-card" onclick='this.classList.toggle("flipped")'><div class="flip-card-inner"><div class="flip-card-front"><div class="tag">Policies of the Ryukyu Disposition</div><div class="title">Propaganda in Education</div><div class="subtitle"></div></div><div class="flip-card-back"><p><b>Propaganda in Education</b></p><p>Japan used mass education in Okinawa to build loyalty.

Initially, there was resistance to Japanese schools and culture from the Ryukyuans. It wasn’t until after the victory of the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) that many Okinawans accepted Japanese rule and even embraced Japanese identity. This wasn't necessarily pure, genuine enthusiasm, but a result of a wave of nationalism and a survival strategy. If Okinawans wanted equal rights, stability, or investment, they had to assimilate and prove themselves to be &quot;truly Japanese&quot;.</p><p>At the same time, Japan treated Okinawa like a distant possession rather than an equal part of the country. It delayed reforms and underinvested in the region, and that neglect led to deep poverty and economic crises. Ironically, being ignored by Japan also meant that Okinawa held onto more of its traditional culture compared to other groups that faced more aggressive assimilation.</p><p>Assimilation and the Japanese identity in Okinawa is very complex, especially in the 20th century.

As stated at the top of this analysis, Ibuki's entrance into AKATSUKI has parallels to the Ryukyu Disposition.</p><p>One distinction that needs to be made at the beginning of this section is the intersectionality of Ibuki's two identities: being born in Okinawa and being raised as an American. This matters, because the themes of KAGETSU have two different implications for Ibuki being a Ryukyuan and Ibuki being an American.</p><h3 id="Themes-of-Globalization-in-the-Audition-and-MEGASPHERE-Arcs">Themes of Globalization in the Audition and MEGASPHERE Arcs</h3><p>As we get into talking about Ibuki, AKATSUKI and the Legend of KAGETSU, these take place at the same time as Nice Arneb Thunder coming from abroad and bringing the MEGASPHERE with him.

On one hand, his Ryukyuan heritage isn’t absent. The MV and instrumentation for Tenshou KAGETSU features substantial Chinese elements<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="Chinese culture is deeply rooted in traditional Ryukyuan culture from centuries of cultural exchange between the Ryukyu Kingdom and China." id="fnref:7">7</a>. His heritage is constantly present and constantly acknowledged in stories, minitalks and voice lines. He frequently references Okinawan culture, directly identifies as Uchinaanchu, speaks and references uchinaaguchi by name, and uchinaaguchi is even being learned by AKATSUKI fans in-canon.</p><p>However, as much as his Ryukyuan identity is acknowledged in-canon, it's not structurally adopted into the group’s identity. Keito and AKATSUKI are taking on elements of American-style assertiveness, but Ibuki is the one taking on Japanese-style high-context behavior. This is what parallels the Ryukyu Disposition.</p><p>I'd like to illustrate the new 和 Keito talks about as a container that holds existing elements and can accommodate new ones. The table below explores the intersectionality of Ibuki's identity and illustrates how each of the three identities (Japanese, American, and Ryukyuan) contributes to or is constrained within that container.</p><table><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Keito (Mainland Japanese)</th><th>Ibuki (American)</th><th>Ibuki (Ryukyuan)</th></tr><tr><td>Handling the Container of 和</td><td>A container Keito owns and monitors, deciding what gets poured into it.</td><td>A container Ibuki pours into and contributes to.</td><td>A container Ibuki lives within.</td></tr><tr><td>Ability to Shape 和</td><td>Keito has the authority to define and change the characteristics of 和.</td><td>Ibuki introduces 和 from an American perspective, but it’s still within the limits defined by Keito.</td><td>Ibuki absorbs existing 和, with no current indication of reshaping it.</td></tr><tr><td>Cultural Contribution They Provide</td><td>Keito redefines the traditional social harmony 和 he's upheld to include hunger and ambition.</td><td>Ibuki's directness, rebellion, assertiveness is valued in pushing AKATSUKI forward.</td><td>Ibuki's language and culture is acknowledged, but it’s nonstructural for AKATSUKI.</td></tr><tr><td>Narrative Function</td><td>Keito represents Japan's evolving image: modernization without losing its identity.</td><td>Ibuki represents cultural exchange with America: useful, equal, inspirational.</td><td>Ibuki represents cultural decoration: his unique background is uplifted, but it doesn't challenge the dominant cultural identity.</td></tr><tr><td>Colonial Dynamics</td><td>Keito embodies the colonializer that absorbs cultural differences without being entirely redefined by it.</td><td>The cultural exchange is equal, as American is another major power, fitting in a dominant cultural framework.</td><td>Ibuki embodies the colonized, included symbolically without providing structural change to the dominant culture.</td></tr></table><p>While Ibuki’s Ryukyuan identity is clearly displayed and demonstrated, it exists in a framework that doesn't allow it to reshape AKATSUKI's core identity. Right now, Ibuki contributes to AKATSUKI, but through his American identity, not his Ryukyuan one. Keito offers inclusion and an equal partnership, but it is on behalf of a competing major power at best (Japanese vs. American) and an assimilation approach at worst (Japanese vs. Ryukyuan).</p><div class="translation-background"><div class="msr-unit" character="Keito"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>Taki.

Uchinaaguachi is also an endangered language. While there are efforts to preserve and teach these traditions (especially in Okinawan diaspora overseas), they're still fragile and need continued support to survive.</p><p>I think the best resource for understanding how Okinawans feel is from Okinawans themselves, so I recommend the following studies that feature surveys and interviews:</p><div class="translation-background"><span style="font-size:15px"><p><b>Taira, K., & Yamauchi, L.

This quest of Ibuki’s is questionable, comparing it to the struggles Okinawans have faced with the aftermath of Japanese assimilation.</p><p>According to Ibuki, he’s searching for something he calls 本当の和風. The first time 本当の和風 is explicitly mentioned is in Final Ceremony. It’s brought up again in The Legend of KAGETSU, Ibuki Idol Story 3 and Sailing Ceremony. It was also directly added to his profile after he joined AKATSUKI. When asked what he means by it, he says he doesn’t know. As of Sailing Ceremony, it still hasn't been revealed what it means, with Ibuki explicitly stating that it doesn’t <em>need</em> to be explained.</p><p>I think the closest we get to understanding what it is he’s searching for is the Guest Exam scene in the Legend of KAGETSU.</p><div class="translation-background"><div class="msr-unit" character="Ibuki"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>Hm~?

To try and find a similar example to what Souma might be showing Ibuki, I chose an Ukiyo-e by Hokusai Katsushika that features a 獅子 (shishi) (<a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/shoki-riding-a-shishi-lion">WikiArt</a>). シーサー and 獅子 are the same kind of creature, so the difference for Ibuki seems to be how it’s been reinterpreted through a Japanese aesthetic.</p><img src="/translation/img/es/other/shishi.jpg"><p>Personally, the fact that what he wants is in the Japanese-style version is sad, given the endangered practices and customs of the Ryukyuans. I find the 本当の和風 storyline offensive and unnecessary, especially since it’s being kept unresolved to the reader what he actually means by it. If the writers wanted to have Ibuki search for a sense of belonging, other themes like brotherhood are explicitly laid out and don’t play with themes of assimilation.</p><p>That said, I think the writers believe they are handling these ideas with care or that they’re progressive, not problematic. Additionally, readers might get the impression that because of AKATSUKI’s cultural exchange with Ibuki’s American side, the writers don’t mean to make a case for assimilation; the offensive Ryukyuan element is just an unfortunate byproduct.</p><p>For example, Ibuki's new self-introduction after he was added to AKATSUKI starts with this line, which indicates he is contributing his background as an Okinawan as well:</p><div class="msr-unit" character="Ibuki"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>My name&#39;s Taki Ibuki. I aim to contribute to AKATSUKI by making the most of my unique Okinawa-born, American-raised background~♪</p></div></div><p>If this is the case, it should be unpacked. To examine this, the following table breaks down (1) a theme present in the text (either explicit or inferred), (2) a historical parallel it connects to (3) a presumed good-faith intention behind the writing, (4) and a critical counterpoint or concern. In doing so, I'd like to show how narratives that <em>think</em> they’re being thoughtful can fall into harmful themes, divorce themselves from history, or speak over groups they’re trying to represent.</p><table><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Historical Lens</th><th>Assumed Intention</th><th>Counterpoint to Intention</th></tr><tr><td>The meaning of 本当の和風 has yet to be revealed</td><td></td><td>本当の和風 ("True Japanese-style") might be about bringing in diverse perspectives and evolving Japan out from a monolithic cultural identity</td><td>That's still assimilation. But even if it wasn't, the narrative insists on not explaining what this "feeling" is; it hasn't earned the benefit of the doubt yet.</td></tr><tr><td>AKATSUKI absorbs Ibuki’s 和</td><td>Okinawans were largely expected to conform to the dominant Japanese identity, not the other way around.</td><td>Ibuki is progressive. He’s actively shaping AKATSUKI too. He mentions contributing Okinawan and American sensibilities to redefine the group’s concept of 和.</td><td>In both the Legend of KAGETSU and his new self-introduction, Ibuki mentions both Okinawan and American influence. However, Keito only references Ibuki's American 和. As of right now, Ibuki takes on more Japanese 和 than he contributes Okinawan 和.</td></tr><tr><td>和 is being redefined</td><td>During the Meiji-era, 和 was used to promote a sense of social harmony. This philosophy helped frame forced assimilation into Japan as a natural extension of shared identity.</td><td>In KAGETSU, 和 is reinterpreted to be something fluid and inclusive. At the same time, Keito denounces abiding by the social harmony of modern-day 和.</td><td>As mentioned before, the "diversity" taken on by AKATSUKI is Ibuki's American identity. As of right now, AKATSUKI hasn't adopted any Ryukyuan cultural influence besides the MV for Tenshou KAGETSU.</td></tr><tr><td>Tradition is being redefined</td><td></td><td>AKATSUKI has always "protected tradition". In KAGETSU, Keito reinterprets that tradition as 伝承<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="Tradition in the sense of passing on folklore, legends, keeping old things alive." id="fnref:3">3</a>, not 伝統<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="Tradition in the sense of keeping things as they always have been." id="fnref:4">4</a>. This disavows always sticking to old customs, and protects old legends from being erased.</td><td>The power to define tradition lies with Keito. Ibuki influences it, but doesn't have authority on it.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ibuki is a fighter in a brotherhood of fighters.</td><td>Japan used Okinawa as a “shield” during WWII, where civilians were sacrificed under the banner of national pride. Okinawans were expected to fight and die for a nation that viewed them as expendable.</td><td>Ibuki can find camaraderie and belonging as a fighter, fighting alongside AKATSUKI. Souma refers to Shinsei AKATSUKI as his “brothers-in-arms”.</td><td>His personal bonds are meaningful, but framing his belonging in the war unit AKATSUKI as pride or honor is offensive, given Okinawa’s forced militarization and sacrifice.</td></tr></table><p>It's worth noting that Ibuki has other unresolved identity issues. The way he speaks about them in the Legend of KAGETSU suggests he’s felt excluded or out of place since his childhood in Okinawa.</p><div class="translation-background">The Legend of KAGETSU, Interlude<div class="msr-unit" character="Ibuki" norsmile><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>— That’s right~ That&#39;s why, no matter what it takes, I want to earn AKATSUKI’s acknowledgement.</p><p><b>Me, someone who can’t accomplish anything.

In his current introduction, he refers to the seniors in AKATSUKI as his 兄様 (<em>niinii</em>, big brother figures), which suggests Keito, Kuro, and Souma offer him a sense of security.</p><p>The personal bonds these characters share are, in themselves, not problematic, because they offer emotional support outside of the themes tied to Ibuki's identity. What <em>is</em> problematic is how Ibuki’s character is framed around his search for 本当の和風, and how the story frames him joining AKATSUKI as the means to achieve it. It implies that becoming truly Japanese or finding true Japanese-style requires taking it in yourself, which (especially as real-world Ryukyuans struggle to keep their customs alive) isn’t a progressive narrative. It’s a harmful assimilation narrative.</p><h2 id="How-Media-Fits-on-the-Global-Stage">How Media Fits on the Global Stage</h2><p>For this last section, I want to highlight how the messaging with Shinsei AKATSUKI can mirror propaganda by talking about current affairs and narratives that face Okinawa today.</p><h3 id="Acknowledging-Grassroots-Separatist-Movements-in-Okinawa">Acknowledging Grassroots Separatist Movements in Okinawa</h3><p>It’s important to acknowledge that there are legitimate grassroots movements in Okinawa that advocate for greater autonomy, demilitarization, and even independence.

I take this approach to contextualize power dynamics that might incentivize media in Japan to promote narratives that emphasize that Okinawa is an inherent part of Japan (or infer there is a true Japanese-style that involves Okinawa).</p><h3 id="Disputes-Between-Global-Powers-in-the-East-China-Sea">Disputes Between Global Powers in the East China Sea</h3><div class="facts-container"><div class="flip-card" onclick='this.classList.toggle("flipped")'><div class="flip-card-inner"><div class="flip-card-front"><div class="tag">Historical Context</div><div class="title">Japan vs. China</div><div class="subtitle"></div></div><div class="flip-card-back"><b>Japan vs. China: Dominance in the East China Sea</b><p>China and Japan have had a long history of grievances.

However, U.S. military presence remains due to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.</p></div></div></div></div><h4 id="Contesting-Islands-Along-the-First-Island-Chain">Contesting Islands Along the First Island Chain</h4><p>The First Island Chain is a line of islands in the Pacific Ocean that the U.S. uses as launching points to contain China and North Korea's military activities. These islands include Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and the Philippines. By contesting the status of these islands on a global stage, China can challenge U.S. military influence in the region and gain footing for itself.</p><table><tr><th>Contesting Taiwan's Independence</th><th>Contesting The Senkaku Islands</th></tr><tr><td><p>Taiwan, an island off the southeastern coast of China, is currently at the heart of tensions in the East China Sea. After losing to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the Chinese Civil War (1945), the Republic of China (ROC) retreated to Taiwan.</p><p>From then on, Taiwan operated independently with its own government, military and economy. However, Beijing constantly asserts historical claims over the island, as any formal declaration of independence might undermine the power of the CCP and inspire other separatist movements in China.</p><p>Taiwan has many strategic advantages, including technology and sway in the global supply chain. Most importantly for this discussion, Taiwan is a key part of the First Island Chain, sitting between China and Japan. If China controlled Taiwan, it would have a better grip on the East China Sea.</p></td><td><p>The Senkaku Islands (or Diaoyu Islands, in China) are uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. These islands are rich in resources and close to vital shipping lanes; they are also fairly close to Okinawa (in the 1300s, it was a waypoint for Chinese traders to get to Ryukyu).</p><p>While Japan currently controls the Senkaku Islands, China and Taiwan claim them as well. In 2023, the U.S. Secretary of Defense claimed that the Senkaku Islands fell under the US-Japan Security Treaty. Therefore, if conflict were to break out over the islands, the U.S. would likely get involved in order to defend Japan.</p></td></tr></table><h4 id="Contesting-Okinawa-s-Status">Contesting Okinawa's Status</h4><p>Okinawa is one of the most critical strategic points in the East China Sea. Located south of mainland Japan, it is a vulnerable point that can be exploited by other nations; this was the primary reason it was annexed in 1879. Currently, its position in the First Island Chain and its increased United States presence helps contain and push back Chinese military movement and naval activity.</p><p>As laid out in the History of the Ryukyu Kingdom Timeline page,<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="The timeline will be released in early July 2025." id="fnref:5">5</a> a long period of time for the Ryukyu Kingdom was spent as both a tributary state to Qing China and a vassal of Japan (1609-1879). To access and maintain trade with Qing China during this period, Japan took steps to present Ryukyu as culturally and politically independent. They did this by enforcing de-Japanification policies. However, as Japan modernized and expanded its empire during the Meiji Restoration centuries later, it began to make historical claims over Ryukyu. By going back on its previous stance, Japan could legitimize its annexation of the Ryukyus.</p><p>China does not officially claim Okinawa. However, it has begun to challenge Japan’s right to sovereignty by highlighting the historical precedent above, alongside Okinawa’s distinct culture and identity. Given the First Island Chain tactic, the US-Japan Security Treaty, and the fact that Okinawa hosts major U.S. military bases (making it critical for America’s presence in Asia), this strategy serves China’s interests: China is able to weaken the U.S.-Japan alliance’s influence in the East China Sea without actually provoking military conflict.</p><p>Keeping that in mind, the nation of Japan is incentivized to assert Okinawa as truly part of its nation. Japanese media that blends Okinawan characters or culture into a broader “Japanese” identity can reflect or reinforce those political narratives.</p><p>In Sailing Ceremony, Ibuki introduces himself like this in the Rhythm Link livestream:</p><div class="msr-unit" character="Ibuki"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>Taki Ibuki, stepping up to the plate! <b>I’m an idol with roots in both Japan and the U.S.~♪</b></p><p>I came to find &quot;true Japanese-style&quot; in AKATSUKI, so be sure to send us lots of “Nice!”s too~☆</p></div></div><p>Consider that this is already different from his usual catchphrase:</p><div class="msr-unit" character="Ibuki"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>I’m Taki Ibuki– born in Okinawa, raised in America.</p></div></div><p>Lines like this are a good example of that nationalistic reinforcement. Time will tell whether this is an intentional change, or a mere excuse as to why he was put in AKATSUKI, but this paired with Ibuki &quot;absorbing&quot; AKATSUKI echoes nationalist and assimilationist messaging whether it means to or not.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I think it sucks that Ibuki has been put in AKATSUKI, and that AKATSUKI has been used as a vehicle for nationalist parallels like this. Even if a piece of media wasn’t created with a political goal in mind, it can still contribute to larger narratives because it doesn't exist in a vacuum. If Ibuki’s story contributes to reinforcing the idea that Okinawa is naturally just part of Japan without addressing its complex history, all it does its act as a form of soft propaganda.</p><p>Understanding what to analyze is key to critical reading. Everything above is meant to help a reader of any kind (e.g., AKATSUKI P, non-AKATSUKI Ps, people unfamiliar with the topic) approach stories with Shinsei AKATSUKI with greater awareness. Being able to recognize underlying patterns (and name them when they appear) is an essential part of engaging critically with media. If you choose to keep reading Shinsei AKATSUKI stories, keep these perspectives in mind and stay alert to where the writing falls short. The current narrative doesn’t offer its own critique of the assimilation themes it has, so it's up to us, the readers, to recognize and question those elements on our own.</p><h2 id="Reading-List">Reading List</h2><p>If you were looking for a starting point for learning more about the historical context of Shinsei AKATSUKI, I hope this post has helped you.
