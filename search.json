Adonis is often subjected to textbook orientalism. He’s broadly put under a cultural umbrella of vaguely “Middle-Eastern”, portrayed as being “sexy” and “exotic”, or as a large and scary foreigner. Hiiro is inferred to be Ainu, but is portrayed as an ignorant person from “the country” who must absorb the ways of “the city”. At times, he’s treated as a laughing stock when he doesn’t know about modern technology or when he &quot;lacks civility&quot;.\nWith the addition of Ibuki, a canonically Ryukyuan indigenous individual, into AKATSUKI, the point of this analysis is to contextualize the Ryukyu Islands’ history with Japan and apply it to Ensemble Stars, so it can be referenced in future translation notes and disclaimers for Shinsei AKATSUKI on my website.

Because of its location in the East China Sea, Ryukyu developed a unique culture and maritime empire through active trade with China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The kingdom maintained a tributary relationship with China before it was invaded by Satsuma of Japan in 1609. From then on, Ryukyu had a three-pronged political status: tributary state, vassal and kingdom. This lasted until 1879 when Japan formally annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom, dissolved its monarchy, and incorporated the islands as the Okinawa Prefecture. This marked the beginning of assimilation policies and erasure of Ryukyuan identity into the 20th century.\nMeiji Restoration and Assimilation Into 和\nAs laid out in the History of the Ryukyu Kingdom Timeline page,5 Commodore Matthew Perry and the U.S. Navy arrived in Japan in 1853 with warships in order to force it to open itself to foreign trade. This came after the United States settled on the western coastline after the Mexican-American war, because it set its sights on Japan as a fueling site for merchant ships. After signing treaties with the United States and other Western Powers, Japan’s closed country policy ended.\nAfter the arrival of the United States, Japan adopted Western institutions and structures to modernize and protect itself. Power was consolidated under the Meiji Emperor and Edo, which was then renamed to Tokyo. The Meiji Constitution and its two-house government was modeled after the Prussian and British parliamentary systems. Western experts were invited to Japan to teach architecture, medical science, law, economics, natural sciences, engineering and more. Japan built factories for textiles, steel, ships, and munitions. This period of time was called the Meiji Restoration.\nTo expand its imperial reach, Japan developed two strategies: making a modern military and creating a unifying national identity.\nBuilding a Strong Military\n富国強兵 (fukoku kyohei, &quot;rich country, strong military&quot;) became the guiding principle of national policy. Economic strength meant developing modern industries, infrastructure, and self-sufficiency. Military strength meant making a powerful, modern army to protect Japan and raise its world power status.\nAfter the Meiji Government consolidated power, it abolished feudal lords and the samurai class. It restructured the military with Western-style ranks, uniforms, industrialization, and training. Mandatory conscriptions were established. Military academies were established, and trained officers taught based on Western military foundations. This allowed Japan to build a professional, modern military and navy.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Historical Context\n      Neighboring Territories\n      \n    \n    \n      Imperialism in Neighboring Territories\n      Other territories like Taiwan, Hokkaido and Korea offered the same strategic and economic gains for Japan as Ryukyu. This period includes the forced assimilation of the Ainu in Hokkaido and the brutal colonization of Korea, which had previously been a tributary state of Qing China.\n    \n  \n\n\nDeveloping a Cultural Identity\n“Wa” is the oldest known term for Japan, first used by China and Korea. The original character 倭 (wa, submissive, dwarf) was derogatory. In the 8th century, Japan replaced the character 倭 with a new one to redefine its image: 和 (wa, harmony, peace). 和 (wa) is used in words associated with traditional Japanese culture, like 和風 (wafu, Japanese-style), 和食 (washoku, Japanese cuisine), and 和服 (wafuku, Japanese clothing).\n\n\n  \n    \n      Historical Context\n      Kokutai 国体\n      \n    \n    \n      National Essence: Kokutai 国体\n      To unify regional identities into one national culture, the Meiji government worked to construct a singular national identity. It did this by leading with the idea of kokutai; the emperor was seen as a divine figure, and the people were like one big family under his rule.\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Historical Context\n      Identity Creation and Reinforcement\n      \n    \n    \n      Identity Creation and Reinforcement: Divine Right of Kings\n      Shinto, Japan’s religion, was elevated to a state ideology, where the emperor was promoted as descended from the divine. This gave him both moral and spiritual authority over the people of Japan. This identity was reinforced through schools, where school children were required to recite doctrine that emphasized loyalty to the emperor and pride in being Japanese.\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Historical Context\n      Assimilation Policies\n      \n    \n    \n      Assimilating Other Territories into Japanese Culture.\n      The 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act forced the Ainu to adopt Japanese names, prohibited their language and customs, and erased their indigenous identity. Policies like 創氏改名 (soushi-kaimei) forced Koreans to adopt Japanese names and prohibited their language.\n    \n  \n\n\nWhile Japan used Western tools to strengthen itself, it wanted to keep its Japanese identity intact too. 和, social harmony, was central to being truly Japanese: it’s a unified society where individual interests should be put aside for the greater good. This same identity was used to justify the assimilation of minority groups, often at the cost of their own cultures and traditions.\nIn the years after the Black Ships came, Japan’s primary motivation for annexing Ryukyu was to secure its southern borders. The Ryukyu Islands’ position south of Japan made it a potential target for Western powers: if these Western powers settled in Ryukyu, they would have easy access to the Japanese mainland. Despite protests from the Chinese, Ryukyuans and even others within the Japanese administration, Ryukyu was formally dissolved and annexed as the Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. This annexation and the policies that followed are also known as the Ryukyu Disposition.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Policies of the Ryukyu Disposition\n      Propaganda in Education\n      \n    \n    \n      Propaganda in Education\n      Japan used mass education in Okinawa to build loyalty. Japan created a public school system from scratch, teaching Japanese language, patriotism, and emperor loyalty. Okinawan locals became teachers, aiding in spreading assimilation efforts.\n      Source: Meyer (2020)\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Policies of the Ryukyu Disposition\n      Getting Rid of Chinese Influence\n      \n    \n    \n      Getting Rid of Chinese Influence\n      The Japanese government replaced the name “Ryukyu” (which comes from the Chinese Liuqiu) with “Okinawa,” a Japanese term. Officials pushed people to stop using “Ryukyu” or “Ryukyuan” by painting the terms as foreign or barbaric, in order to break historical ties with China.\n      Source: Meyer (2020)\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Policies of the Ryukyu Disposition\n      Erasing or Rewriting History\n      \n    \n    \n      Erasing or Rewriting History\n      Ryukyuan history was discouraged in schools and sometimes banned or mocked. Traditions were incorporated into Japanese culture, like labeling the Ryukyuan religion as a form of Shinto or linking Ryukyuan kings to Japanese ancestry.\n      Source: Meyer (2020)\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      The Ryukyu Disposition\n      Culture Prohibitions\n      \n    \n    \n      Culture Prohibitions\n      Certain customs like traditional hairstyles or local dialects were suppressed, though some customs faded naturally or were adapted. Language suppression wasn’t consistently enforced until wartime. but when it was, dialect cards were used to punish people who spoke in their dialect.\n      Source: Meyer (2020)\n    \n  \n\n\nOkinawa’s relationship with Japan was complicated. Initially, there was resistance to Japanese schools and culture from the Ryukyuans. It wasn’t until after the victory of the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) that many Okinawans accepted Japanese rule and even embraced Japanese identity. This wasn't necessarily pure, genuine enthusiasm, but a result of a wave of nationalism and a survival strategy. If Okinawans wanted equal rights, stability, or investment, they had to assimilate and prove themselves to be &quot;truly Japanese&quot;.\nAt the same time, Japan treated Okinawa like a distant possession rather than an equal part of the country. It delayed reforms and underinvested in the region, and that neglect led to deep poverty and economic crises. Ironically, being ignored by Japan also meant that Okinawa held onto more of its traditional culture compared to other groups that faced more aggressive assimilation.\nAssimilation and the Japanese identity in Okinawa is very complex, especially in the 20th century. I would highly recommend you read both The Boundaries of &quot;The Japanese&quot; and Between a Forgotten Colony and an Abandoned Prefecture regarding this period of time. The Boundaries of &quot;The Japanese&quot; (Oguma, 2014) in particular breaks down the lead-up to and aftermath of Ryukyu's annexation.\nLegend of KAGETSU Thematic Analysis\nAKATSUKI is a unit based around 和風 (wafu, Japanese-style). Ibuki is Ryukyuan2. As stated at the top of this analysis, Ibuki's entrance into AKATSUKI has parallels to the Ryukyu Disposition.\nOne distinction that needs to be made at the beginning of this section is the intersectionality of Ibuki's two identities: being born in Okinawa and being raised as an American. This matters, because the themes of KAGETSU have two different implications for Ibuki being a Ryukyuan and Ibuki being an American.\nThemes of Globalization in the Audition and MEGASPHERE Arcs\nAs we get into talking about Ibuki, AKATSUKI and the Legend of KAGETSU, these take place at the same time as Nice Arneb Thunder coming from abroad and bringing the MEGASPHERE with him. Although Nice is not directly connected to Ibuki and AKATSUKI after Ibuki turns his offer down, their stories mirror the same parallel to the Meiji Restoration, where global influence comes in to challenge the status quo and Japan takes on these global principles to modernize and survive.\nThere are pieces within the stories that outright or thematically resemble the Black Ship. When fine is gathered outside the Audition venue in VS AUDIENCE Chapter 1, Eichi makes a direct reference to the Black Ships.\n\nHehe. Thanks for the tip. Perhaps I’d gotten jealous that Thunderbolt had caught Tori&#39;s interest.\nHowever, I&#39;m also anticipating the proverbial ships moving in.1\nTheir movements have purpose: it seems that they’re trying to scoop up the talent that ES failed to pick up in my place.\n\n\nIn the Audition Arc, Nice reveals to Seiya that bringing in MELLOW DEAR US (an overseas idol unit) is part of his plan to shake things around and reset the idol scene. He plans to use MELLOW DEAR US as a model example and push the industry (particularly, the P-Agency) to evolve. While idols will struggle or feel threatened, the idea is that this challenge will lead to growth for everyone. Seiya calls it “terraforming” the idol world.\nWhen the MEGASPHERE Arc begins, Nice brings a (literal) ship to hover over ES. In it are all sorts of advancements. For the next month, ES Idols are put to the test to use these resources in order to stream.\nIn the Shinsei AKATSUKI BRIGHT ME UP!!! Minitalks, the topic of the MEGASPHERE comes up, and Ibuki says this:\n\nIt&#39;s quite noisy before the live, hm? Looks like there are some people running around for no reason too...\n\nNow, now. It&#39;s the first time we&#39;re holdin&#39; a live in a place like this, I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s in high spirits is all.\n\nI never thought that we&#39;d stand on a stage this huge~ Right~?\n\nIf the player says, &quot;It feels like it's the size of America&quot;...\nNow that you mention it, apparently this so-called &quot;me-ga-su-fii-a&quot; airship was made in a foreign country.\n\nIt crossed the ocean to come here to Japan just like me~ Kinda gives me a sense of kinship~♪\n\nCrossed? More like flew... I did learn that when it&#39;s this stupid-huge of a machine, I don&#39;t get motion-sickness. \n\n\nAdaptation for Survival\nI think this deliberate mention of relating to the MEGASPHERE is supposed to parallel the Black Ships and connect Ibuki's role to one of the primary themes of the Legend of KAGETSU: adapting to survive in the face of the future.\nThis theme is evoked in the song Tenshou KAGETSU:\n\n  \n    Keito\n    The beating of our hearts are the drum playing the Fill-in that clears the darkness of the new moon\n    00:50\n  \n  \n    Ibuki\n    Can you feel it kicking up?  – Brush up, impose, throw down, make change\n    00:53\n  \n  \n    Kuro\n    Time doesn’t stop\n    00:57\n  \n  \n    Souma\n    In order to exist in this era\n    00:59\n  \n    \n    Keito, Souma\n    Our battered bodies are medals of honor too\n    01:00\n  \n  \n    Kuro, Ibuki\n    To aimlessly waste away is the sentiment of a king\n    01:02\n  \n  ...\n  \n    Souma\n    Now, the full moon has appeared, it's Showtime for all to be burst open and revealed\n    02:15\n  \n  \n    Kuro\n    We’ve been waiting for so long, is it just as we’ve wished? What is the dream we’ve screamed out for once before?\n    02:18\n  \n  \n    Keito\n    Time doesn’t stop\n    02:22\n  \n  \n    Ibuki\n    We’re surviving in this era\n    02:24\n  \n  \n    All\n    If you only have half the faith in what you believe in, won’t you only get half out of the world too?\n    02:26\n  \n\nIn the Legend of KAGETSU, Keito suspects Rhythm Link wants to use AKATSUKI’s obedience and discipline to mold them into a convenient, controlled successor. He fears that in this position, AKATSUKI won’t be allowed to grow or change. After meeting Ibuki in VS AUDIENCE, Keito sees potential in how his approach clashes with AKATSUKI's. Initially, he invites Ibuki to be a guest with AKATSUKI in order to shake out of Rhythm Link's idea of what makes something &quot;like AKATSUKI&quot;.\n\nI wanted to make it clear I wasn’t going to let them control AKATSUKI as they wished, while not opposing the agency&#39;s intentions straight-on.\nI tried everything in my power. I tried to adopt what was trendy into the arrangements of new AKATSUKI songs.\nBut the overall response never changed. Apparently, every song was “fit for AKATSUKI”.\nIt’s probably because I’m too steeped in the traditional performing arts that I can&#39;t get the range right. It&#39;s hard to strike a balance.\nIt was at that moment, in 4piece… In that audition where I came across Taki.\n\nEh? Then, the reason Hasumi-san called out to me was…\n\nThat’s right. When we had our jam session together, I felt like I could see the future of AKATSUKI.\nAKATSUKI is a unit that takes pride in the traditional performance arts.\nBut we’re not an antique or a curio; it’s not an antiquated unit. We’re idols who sing and dance in front of people who live in the now.\nEven if AKATSUKI’s performances change, AKATSUKI stays the same. Even if something on the surface changes, the soul of AKATSUKI is eternal.\n\n… That’s right. That’s what we learned from Rumbling Heaven and Earth.\n\nRight. We take the things we’ve cultivated in the past, change it to suit the modern age, and carry it with us into the new era.\n\n \nLater, after the Legend of KAGETSU show, AKATSUKI formally invites Ibuki to join their unit. By integrating Ibuki into AKATSUKI, Keito can keep its core identity, while adapting and expanding it to stay independent and survive outside pressure in the future. However, when Keito talks about being an equal partner with Ibuki, or taking on his &quot;harmony&quot; (和), he's mainly discussing the interplay between the Japanese 和 and Ibuki's American identity. This makes it a cultural negotiation between two major powers (Japan and the United States), a reflection of the events that occurred during the Meiji Restoration.\nThere's a major clash in the story between low-context American culture (saying what you want, making deals, clearly stating expectations) and high-context Japanese culture (leaving things unsaid, implying meaning through the way you act, relying on unspoken expectations). Throughout the story, Ibuki learns Japanese-style high-context behavior (such as withholding information to protect AKATSUKI), while Keito learns American-style low-context communication (being direct, assertive, and rebellious when protecting AKATSUKI).\n\n(Maybe this kinda thing is the harmonious harmony6 Hasumi-san was talking about~?)\n(Both the Okinawan and American dispositions I carry with me, mixed with the harmony AKATSUKI brings with them. At a glance, it doesn’t seem like it fits, but I blend right in. How strange~)\n(I’m absorbing the harmony of this mainland. At times, I’m introducing harmony from the American perspective too.)\n(— I’ll show you I’ll find that “true Japanese-style”.)\n\n(What Taki has that AKATSUKI doesn’t— it’s that thirst. And from that thirst comes a kind of hunger.)\n(In Japan, there is a tendency to view greed as despicable— something to be ashamed of. Because of that, I tried not to bring it to the surface. I had figured that restraint was a virtue.)\n(But I’ve had enough of moderation. AKATSUKI is a unit that honors good old fashioned harmony, but we’re idols who make the most of the present and take on the future.)\n(“All worldly things are impermanent” is what the world runs on. If we only keep our eyes on the past and present, we’ll absolutely lose sight of the future.)\n(I won’t let that happen to AKATSUKI.)\n(Even if it’s despicable, I’ll hungrily take in everything, and aim for a harmony that holds up in the face of the future.)\n\n\nIbuki’s Ryukyuan identity is a separate matter, and this is how the exchange of 和 becomes unbalanced. On one hand, allusions to or context relating to Ryukyuan heritage isn’t absent. His heritage is constantly present and constantly acknowledged in stories, minitalks and voice lines. The MV and instrumentation for Tenshou KAGETSU features substantial Chinese elements, a possible reference to the Ryukyu Kingdom’s historical relationship with China.7 He frequently references Okinawan culture, directly identifies as Uchinaanchu, speaks and references uchinaaguchi, one of the Ryukyuan languages, by name, and uchinaaguchi is even being learned by AKATSUKI fans in-canon.\nHowever, as much as his Ryukyuan identity is acknowledged in-canon, it's not structurally adopted into the group’s identity. Keito and AKATSUKI are taking on elements of American-style assertiveness, but Ibuki is the one taking on Japanese-style high-context behavior. This is what parallels the Ryukyu Disposition.\nI'd like to illustrate the new 和 Keito talks about as a container that holds existing elements and can accommodate new ones. The table below explores the intersectionality of Ibuki's identity and illustrates how each of the three identities (Japanese, American, and Ryukyuan) contributes to or is constrained within that container.\n\n  \n    Aspect\n    Keito (Mainland Japanese)\n    Ibuki (American)\n    Ibuki (Ryukyuan)\n  \n  \n    Handling the Container of 和\n    A container Keito owns and monitors, deciding what gets poured into it.\n    A container Ibuki pours into and contributes to.\n    A container Ibuki lives within.\n  \n  \n    Ability to Shape 和\n    Keito has the authority to define and change the characteristics of 和.\n    Ibuki introduces 和 from an American perspective, but it’s still within the limits defined by Keito.\n    Ibuki absorbs existing 和, with no current indication of reshaping it. Instead, his indigenous characteristics are now considered 和 under AKATSUKI.\n  \n  \n    Cultural Contribution They Provide\n    Keito redefines the traditional social harmony 和 he's upheld to include hunger and ambition.\n    Ibuki's directness, rebellion, assertiveness is valued in pushing AKATSUKI forward.\n    Ibuki's language and culture is acknowledged, but it’s nonstructural for AKATSUKI.\n  \n  \n    Narrative Function\n    Keito represents Japan's evolving image: modernization without losing its identity.\n    Ibuki represents cultural exchange with America: useful, equal, inspirational.\n    Ibuki represents cultural decoration: his unique background is present, but it doesn't challenge the dominant cultural identity. Instead, it is presented as a “subset” of it.\n  \n  \n    Colonial Dynamics\n    Keito embodies the colonializer that absorbs cultural differences without being entirely redefined by it.\n    The cultural exchange is equal, as American is another major power, fitting in a dominant cultural framework.\n    Ibuki embodies the colonized, included symbolically without providing structural change to the dominant culture.\n  \n\nWhile Ibuki’s Ryukyuan identity is clearly displayed and demonstrated, it exists in a framework that doesn't allow it to reshape AKATSUKI's core identity. Right now, Ibuki contributes to AKATSUKI, but through his American identity, not his Ryukyuan one. Keito offers inclusion and an equal partnership, but it is on behalf of a competing major power at best (Japanese vs. American) and an assimilation approach at worst (Japanese vs. Ryukyuan); these are both reminiscent of the Meiji Restoration and its events.\n\nTaki. You’ve been saying that we’re “letting you be involved in the live with AKATSUKI”.\nYou certainly are playing the role of guest, but what I want from you isn’t to be a guest; I want us to stand as equals.\nThat harmony of Japanese culture is the word &quot;harmony&quot;.\nThings like “Fitting just right” and “blending in seamlessly” are subtle, but unmistakable. That is what harmony is all about.\nIt doesn’t matter to me if you did something like cause us trouble like you said. Well, I am going to lecture you, though…\n\n\nDoes a colonizer have the right to repurpose or glorify the concept of 和? A concept that has historically been used to assimilate groups like the Ryukyuans? And what’s being made inclusive in this scene isn’t the marginalized Ryukyuan identity, but another dominant culture, the United States. Phrasing it like &quot;fitting just right&quot; and &quot;blending in&quot; have overt connotations of assimilation.\nIbuki and his search for 本当の和風\nBetween Ryukyu's assimilation into Japan and older generations passing away, many Ryukyuan customs are fading or no longer practiced, including but not limited to traditional tattoos, cultural rituals, and festivals. Uchinaaguachi is also an endangered language. While there are efforts to preserve and teach these traditions (especially in Okinawan diaspora overseas), they're still fragile and need continued support to survive.\nI think the best resource for understanding how Okinawans feel is from Okinawans themselves, so I recommend the following studies that feature surveys and interviews:\n\n\nTaira, K., & Yamauchi, L. A. (2018). Okinawan consciousness and identity salience and development among Okinawan university students studying in Hawai ‘i. Journal of International Students, 8(1), 431-452.\nKato, J. (2025). The Identity and Networks of Uchinanchu in the 7th Worldwide Uchinanchu Festival-Based on the Survey on Festival Participants.\nHeinrich, P., & Valsecchi, G. (2023). Ryukyuan language reclamation: Individual struggle and social change. In Discourses of identity: Language learning, teaching, and reclamation Perspectives in Japan (pp. 139-157). Cham: Springer International Publishing.\n\n\nWhile Ibuki's absorption of 和 is what makes his entrance into AKATSUKI problematic, his current character motivation of searching for 本当の和風 (hontou no wafu, true Japanese-style) is what makes the character of Ibuki itself problematic. This quest of Ibuki’s is questionable, comparing it to the struggles Okinawans have faced with the aftermath of Japanese assimilation.\nAccording to Ibuki, he’s searching for something he calls 本当の和風. The first time 本当の和風 is explicitly mentioned is in Final Ceremony. It’s brought up again in The Legend of KAGETSU, Ibuki Idol Story 3 and Sailing Ceremony. It was also directly added to his profile after he joined AKATSUKI. When asked what he means by it, he says he doesn’t know. As of Sailing Ceremony, it still hasn't been revealed what it means, with Ibuki explicitly stating that it doesn’t need to be explained.\nI think the closest we get to understanding what it is he’s searching for is the Guest Exam scene in the Legend of KAGETSU.\n\nHm~? Kanzaki-san’s holding a picture? With a shiisaa drawn on it~?\n“Shii-saa”...? No, this is a lion?\n\nKanzaki. Neither term is wrong. In Okinawa, they call lions “shiisaa”.\n\nHmm. I see. If that’s the case, as Taki says, there is a “shii-saa” drawn on this hanging scroll.\n\nIt’s definitely a shiisaa, but it has a completely different feel from an Okinawan shiisaa~?\n\nThe color, maybe~? Or maybe its shape~? I dunno what’s giving it that sorta feel, but…\n\n— Yeah, I really do want this~\n\n\nOn the left are シーサー (shiisaa) statues in Okinawa (Nakamoto Forestry). To try and find a similar example to what Souma might be showing Ibuki, I chose an Ukiyo-e by Hokusai Katsushika that features a 獅子 (shishi) (WikiArt). シーサー and 獅子 are the same kind of creature, so the difference for Ibuki seems to be how it’s been reinterpreted through a Japanese aesthetic.\n\nThe fact that what he wants is in the Japanese-style version is, personally, sad, given the endangered practices and customs of the Ryukyuans. The 本当の和風 storyline is offensive and unnecessary, especially since it’s being kept unresolved to the reader what he actually means by it. If the writers wanted to have Ibuki search for a sense of belonging, other themes could have been laid out that don’t play with themes of assimilation.\nThat said, it’s possible that the writers believe they are handling these ideas with care. Additionally, readers might get the impression that because of AKATSUKI’s cultural exchange with Ibuki’s American side, the writers don’t mean to make a case for assimilation; the offensive Ryukyuan element is just an unfortunate byproduct.\nFor example, Ibuki's new self-introduction after he was added to AKATSUKI starts with this line, which indicates he is contributing his background as an Okinawan as well:\nMy name&#39;s Taki Ibuki. I aim to contribute to AKATSUKI by making the most of my unique Okinawa-born, American-raised background~♪\n\nIf we are to assume this is the case, let’s unpack how it still doesn't hold water. To examine this, the following table breaks down (1) a theme present in the text (either explicit or inferred), (2) a historical parallel it connects to (3) a presumed good-faith intention behind the writing, (4) and a critical counterpoint or concern. In doing so, I'd like to show how narratives that think they’re being thoughtful can fall into harmful themes, divorce themselves from history, or speak over groups they’re trying to represent.\n\n  \n    Theme\n    Historical Lens\n    Assumed Intention\n    Counterpoint to Intention\n  \n  \n    The meaning of 本当の和風 has yet to be revealed\n    \n    本当の和風 (\"True Japanese-style\") might be about bringing in diverse perspectives and evolving Japan out from a monolithic cultural identity, or refer to something else entirely.\n    That's still assimilation. But even if it wasn't, the narrative insists on not explaining what this \"feeling\" is; it hasn't earned the benefit of the doubt.\n  \n  \n    AKATSUKI absorbs Ibuki’s 和\n    Okinawans were largely expected to conform to the dominant Japanese identity, not the other way around.\n    Ibuki is progressive. He’s actively shaping AKATSUKI too. He mentions contributing Okinawan and American sensibilities to redefine the group’s concept of 和.\n    In both the Legend of KAGETSU and his new self-introduction, Ibuki mentions both Okinawan and American influence. However, Keito only references Ibuki's American 和. As of right now, Ibuki takes on more Japanese 和 than he contributes Okinawan 和.\n  \n  \n    和 is being redefined\n    During the Meiji-era, 和 was used to promote a sense of social harmony. This philosophy helped frame forced assimilation into Japan as a natural extension of shared identity.\n    In KAGETSU, 和 is reinterpreted to be something fluid and inclusive. At the same time, Keito denounces abiding by the social harmony of modern-day 和.\n    As mentioned before, the \"diversity\" taken on by AKATSUKI is Ibuki's American identity. As of right now, AKATSUKI hasn't adopted any Ryukyuan cultural influence.\n  \n  \n    Tradition is being redefined\n    \n    AKATSUKI has always \"protected tradition\". In KAGETSU, Keito reinterprets that tradition as 伝承3, not 伝統4. This disavows always sticking to old customs, and protects old legends from being erased.\n    The power to define tradition lies with Keito. Ibuki influences it, but doesn't have authority on it.\n    \n  \n  \n    Ibuki is a fighter in a brotherhood of fighters.\n    Japan used Okinawa as a “shield” during WWII, where civilians were sacrificed under the banner of national pride. Okinawans were expected to fight and die for a nation that viewed them as expendable.\n    Ibuki can find camaraderie and belonging as a fighter, fighting alongside AKATSUKI. Souma refers to Shinsei AKATSUKI as his “brothers-in-arms”.\n    His personal bonds are meaningful, but framing his belonging in the war unit AKATSUKI as pride or honor is offensive, given Okinawa’s forced militarization and sacrifice.\n  \n\nIt's worth noting that Ibuki has other unresolved identity issues. The way he speaks about them in the Legend of KAGETSU suggests he’s felt excluded or out of place since his childhood in Okinawa.\n\nThe Legend of KAGETSU, Interlude\n— That’s right~ That&#39;s why, no matter what it takes, I want to earn AKATSUKI’s acknowledgement.\nMe, someone who can’t accomplish anything. Me, an outcast. And yet, this is the one and only place I’ve ever yearned for all on my own~\n\nThe Legend of KAGETSU, Epilogue 2\n(I don’t really want to be rejected anymore. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been excluded from all kinds of circles~)\n\n\nThere is also a theme of brotherhood: he used to be the big brother figure of a community and directly denies NiceP's offer in Esupuri because he doesn't want to play the role. In his current introduction, he refers to the seniors in AKATSUKI as his 兄様 (niinii, big brother figures), which suggests Keito, Kuro, and Souma offer him a sense of security.\nWhile these relationships seek to resolve his feelings of isolation, doing so through a unit that represents the traditional Japanese continues to bring issues. It suggests that only by compromising aspects of his identity can he acquire brotherhood and security alongside his Japanese companions. Presenting the unit AKATSUKI as a guiding figure for Ibuki resembles the idea of nationalistic paternalism; the idea that a subsidiary territory or region is astray, rebellious, or even backwards, and must be “reeled in” by a major force. Pairing this with how Ibuki’s character is framed around his search for 本当の和風, and how the story frames him joining AKATSUKI as the means to achieve it, it implies that becoming truly Japanese or finding true Japanese-style requires taking it in yourself, which (especially as real-world Ryukyuans struggle to keep their customs alive) isn’t a progressive narrative. It’s a harmful assimilation narrative.\nHow Media Fits on the Global Stage\nFor this last section, I want to highlight how the messaging with Shinsei AKATSUKI can mirror propaganda by talking about current affairs and narratives that face Okinawa today.\nAcknowledging Grassroots Separatist Movements in Okinawa\nIt’s important to acknowledge that there are legitimate grassroots movements in Okinawa that advocate for greater autonomy, demilitarization, and even independence. These concerns are not geopolitical, but rooted in identity, lived experience, and historical grievances. Discussions about the East China Sea can often overlook the Okinawan perspective and reduce the subject to geopolitics alone. This post doesn’t intend to overlook those concerns.\nHowever, this section will remain on the geopolitical interests surrounding Okinawa (and other islands in the East China Sea). I take this approach to contextualize power dynamics that might incentivize media in Japan to promote narratives that emphasize that Okinawa is an inherent part of Japan (or infer there is a true Japanese-style that involves Okinawa).\nDisputes Between Global Powers in the East China Sea\n\n\n  \n    \n      Historical Context\n      Japan vs. China\n      \n    \n    \n      Japan vs. China: Dominance in the East China Sea\n      China and Japan have had a long history of grievances. In today’s era, the geopolitical rivalry between China and Japan centers on strategic control and influence in the East China Sea. To both nations, controlling the region is essential to their national security and economic interests.\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Historical Context\n      U.S.-Japan Security Treaty (1960)\n      \n    \n    \n      U.S.-Japan Security Treaty (1960): Strong U.S. Presence in Asia.\n      A mutual defense pact that says if Japan is attacked, the U.S. will help defend it. In return, Japan will allow the U.S. to keep military bases in Japan, including Okinawa. This is especially meant to deter China or North Korea. Read here.\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Historical Context\n      The United States Discovers Okinawa's Advantage in WWII\n      \n    \n    \n      The United States Discovers Okinawa's Advantage in WWII\n      During the Battle of Okinawa in World War II, the United States used Okinawa as a key launching point for operations against mainland Japan. After the war, the United States controlled Okinawa until 1972, when it was returned to Japan. However, U.S. military presence remains due to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      Historical Context\n      Paternalism: China and Taiwan\n      \n    \n    \n      Nationalistic Paternalism: China and Taiwan\n      The idea of “Mother China” and Taiwan is an example of nationalistic paternalism. This propaganda features the image of a \"mother\", often associated with China, in order to paint Taiwan as a rebellious child that must return to its family.\n    \n  \n\n\nContesting Islands Along the First Island Chain\nThe First Island Chain is a line of islands in the Pacific Ocean that the U.S. uses as launching points to contain China and North Korea's military activities. These islands include Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and the Philippines. By contesting the status of these islands on a global stage, China can challenge U.S. military influence in the region and gain footing for itself.\n\n  \n    Contesting Taiwan's Independence\n    Contesting The Senkaku Islands\n  \n  \n    Taiwan, an island off the southeastern coast of China, is currently at the heart of tensions in the East China Sea. After losing to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the Chinese Civil War (1945), the Republic of China (ROC) retreated to Taiwan. \n    From then on, Taiwan operated independently with its own government, military and economy. However, Beijing constantly asserts historical claims over the island, as any formal declaration of independence might undermine the power of the CCP and inspire other separatist movements in China. \n    Taiwan has many strategic advantages, including technology and sway in the global supply chain. Most importantly for this discussion, Taiwan is a key part of the First Island Chain, sitting between China and Japan. If China controlled Taiwan, it would have a better grip on the East China Sea.\n    The Senkaku Islands (or Diaoyu Islands, in China) are uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. These islands are rich in resources and close to vital shipping lanes; they are also fairly close to Okinawa (in the 1300s, it was a waypoint for Chinese traders to get to Ryukyu). \n    While Japan currently controls the Senkaku Islands, China and Taiwan claim them as well. In 2023, the U.S. Secretary of Defense claimed that the Senkaku Islands fell under the US-Japan Security Treaty. Therefore, if conflict were to break out over the islands, the U.S. would likely get involved in order to defend Japan.\n  \n\n\nContesting Okinawa's Status\nOkinawa is one of the most critical strategic points in the East China Sea. Located south of mainland Japan, it is a vulnerable point that can be exploited by other nations; this was the primary reason it was annexed in 1879. Currently, its position in the First Island Chain and its increased United States presence helps contain and push back Chinese military movement and naval activity.\nAs laid out in the History of the Ryukyu Kingdom Timeline page,5 a long period of time for the Ryukyu Kingdom was spent as both a tributary state to Qing China and a vassal of Japan (1609-1879). To access and maintain trade with Qing China during this period, Japan took steps to present Ryukyu as culturally and politically independent. They did this by enforcing de-Japanification policies. However, as Japan modernized and expanded its empire during the Meiji Restoration centuries later, it began to make historical claims over Ryukyu. By going back on its previous stance, Japan could legitimize its annexation of the Ryukyus.\nChina does not officially claim Okinawa. However, it has begun to challenge Japan’s right to sovereignty by highlighting the historical precedent above, alongside Okinawa’s distinct culture and identity. Given the First Island Chain tactic, the US-Japan Security Treaty, and the fact that Okinawa hosts major U.S. military bases (making it critical for America’s presence in Asia), this strategy serves China’s interests: China is able to weaken the U.S.-Japan alliance’s influence in the East China Sea without actually provoking military conflict.\nKeeping that in mind, the nation of Japan is incentivized to assert Okinawa as truly part of its nation. Japanese media that blends Okinawan characters or culture into a broader “Japanese” identity can reflect or reinforce those political narratives.\nIn Sailing Ceremony, Ibuki introduces himself like this in the Rhythm Link livestream:\nTaki Ibuki, stepping up to the plate! I’m an idol with roots in both Japan and the U.S.~♪\nI came to find &quot;true Japanese-style&quot; in AKATSUKI, so be sure to send us lots of “Nice!”s too~☆\n\nConsider that this is already different from his usual catchphrase:\nI’m Taki Ibuki– born in Okinawa, raised in America.\n\nLines like this are a good example of that nationalistic reinforcement. Whether it means to or not, this paired with Ibuki &quot;absorbing&quot; AKATSUKI echoes nationalist and assimilationist messaging.\nConclusion\nI think it sucks that Ibuki has been put in AKATSUKI, and that AKATSUKI has been used as a vehicle for nationalist parallels like this. Whether or not a piece of media is created with a political gain in mind is insignificant: it will still contribute to larger narratives because it doesn't exist in a vacuum.\nThe narrative offers no introspection or critique of these assimilistic parallels, and it lacks cultural awareness. This approach encourages readers to take what is given to them at face value, and will reinforce the existing nationalistic perspective that Okinawa is just a subset of Japan meant to enhance the nation. It is also worth noting that the Ryukyu indigenous peoples are not a recognized indigenous peoples within the nation. If Ibuki’s story contributes to reinforcing the idea that Okinawa is naturally just part of Japan without addressing its complex history, all it does its act as a form of soft propaganda.\nUnderstanding what to analyze is key to critical reading. Everything above is meant to help a reader of any kind (e.g., AKATSUKI P, non-AKATSUKI Ps, people unfamiliar with the topic) approach stories with Shinsei AKATSUKI with greater awareness. Being able to recognize underlying patterns (and name them when they appear) is an essential part of engaging critically with media. If you choose to keep reading Shinsei AKATSUKI stories, keep these perspectives in mind and stay alert to where the writing falls short. With the narrative failing to offer cultural awareness, it's up to us, the readers, to recognize and question those elements on our own.\nUpdates\n6/2 Original post\n6/5 Section edits, clarifications and typo fixes made based on two sets of feedback (Thank you!)\nReading List\nIf you were looking for a starting point for learning more about the historical context of Shinsei AKATSUKI, I hope this post has helped you.

At the time Satsuma invaded Ryukyu in 1609, Japan and China did not trade together. Japan wanted to access the trade the Chinese had with the Ryukyus. To do so, it implemented a series of de-Japanification policies to give the Ryukyus the appearance of a kingdom independent of Japanese influence. In doing so, Ryukyu went through a period of sinofication, or becoming more Chinese."},{"title":"Another Day By Your Side","url":"/translation//another_day_by_your_side/","content":"\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n                    Kafka\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Media\n                \n                \n                    18Trip\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Proofreading\n                \n                \n                    azurecrystalz\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nChapter 1\n\n    Location: HAMA House, Living Room\n\nHere, Chief-chan.

I must’ve had a proper break at some point, but…\nThe business I’ve been working on lately has managed to settle down, so I wanna take a breather sometime soon… Maybe my usual fishing spot or something.\n\nThat sounds nice. It’s been a while, so how about we go?\n\nWoof, woof!\n\nI know, I know, you can come too, Shumai.\n… That’s right.

Any more of this tugging left and right and I’ll rip in two.\n\nAhaha, you’re as popular as ever, huh. Mister Kafka?\n… You were busy with work, but you still made the rounds here. That must’ve been tough.\n\nIt’s not a big deal.\nAll of the kids here have been hospitalized for a long time, so I just wanted to give them something to look forward to.\n\nYou’re so gentle, huh Kafka?\n\nI’m just doing what I can.\nAll I’m doing is giving these kids what you’ve given to me.\nBesides—\nI’ve made arrangements for them to go with their families on tours organized by HAMA Tours when they get discharged. So they’ll need to get better soon.\n\nHow cunning…\n(... He said that, but Kafka’s teasing them.)\n\nMister…\n\nHow’s your health holding up? You had surgery the other day, right?\n\nYeah. Mister’s been looking out for me, so I did my best.\nMy chest still hurts a little, but… I can breathe easier than I could before. I can play with everyone else today too…!\n\n… I see.

It doesn’t hurt anywhere.\nIs this the time to worry about me? You&#39;re soaking wet from all the splashing, Kafka.\nYeah, before anything, let’s get you completely dried off. Be careful not to catch a cold.\n\nI-... I can do it myself! Talk about a soaking wet rat, you’re not one to talk either…\nHonestly… You’re always about others over yourself.\nStill… That. It’s that gentleness that makes you, you.\nThanks.\n\n\n    Location: HAMA Downtown\n\nIn the end, we didn’t catch the boss.\n\nSo annoying… I thought I’d get to show off my strong point, but ended up the total opposite, I came off completely uncool.\n\nWhat’re you saying, Kafka? You’re always cool, y’know.\n\n… Honestly, you’re no fair. Saying things so honestly like that…\nAt any rate, it won’t be like this next time.\n\nThat so? Next time we’ll have a rematch. We’ll definitely catch the boss then!\n\n… That’s a little different than what I had in mind. Well, whatever.\nHey, we still have time, you know.\n\nYeah. I told Yuki-nii I’d be a little late today anyways. Was there anywhere else you wanted to go?\n\nI was thinking I wanted to take our time and take a detour on our way back.\nSeems like Shumai hasn’t gotten his fill of walking yet either.\n\nWoof! Woofwoof!\n\nThere, there, good boy, good boy. (Petting)\n… Today was so much fun, I don’t want it to end just yet.\nSo, just a little longer. Until the sun sets… Just a little longer is enough for me.\nLet me have you all to myself. How’s that sound? Kaede-chan.\n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ お兄ちゃん (onii-chan) is an honorific for one's older brother.

I could do anything thanks to the ninja provisions I ate~♪)\n(The path of a ninja is by no means simple, but…)\n(If I make ninja training too harsh, any member that’s joined the Ninja Association might quit because the difficulty’s too steep.)\n(On the other hand, if I put more of a focus on lecturing the material, it’ll get boring. Hm~m, it’s tough being the head of a club.)\n(Well, I’m the only member of the Ninja Association so far, so...)\n(If this were a popular club, there wouldn’t be any shortage of worries for a club head managing a lot of people!)\n(I&#39;m a teeny bit jealous, though. If the Ninja Association could get just three members at the very least, it could be promoted to club-status.)\n(At this stage, it’s a dream within a dream. Today marks another day of devoting myself to Ninja Association training on my own…)\n(No, no! Don&#39;t lose heart!)\n(I’ll work hard to train with the same enthusiasm I had when I started Ninja Association!)\n(As long as I do that, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll meet someone with my same aspirations someday!)\n(I will show the world the splendor of ninjas...☆)\n\n\nUu~ I’m so bored. There’s no Track and Field Club activities today, so I can’t go on a run. My frustrations are startin’ to build up, yanno~...?\n\n(Huff, huff)…♪\n\nHuh? Someone’s out there running on the sports grounds? Is it someone from the track team? Uu~ I can’t see very well. Lemme get a little closer. Da~sh…☆\n\n(Oh, that was a new record! The fundoshi1 around my waist didn’t touch the ground, even after one lap!)\n(The wind direction’s excellent today, so I’ll keep at it like this for two or three more laps~♪)\n\nEh-hem, I caught up! I thought I saw someone, it was Shinobu-chan! Shinobu-chan, wanna race?\nTrack and Field Club didn’t have any activities today so I was feelin’ pretty bleh.\nBut Shinobu-chan’s here! There aren’t any Track and Field Club members running around, so we won’t end up bumpin’ into anyone. Wahoo~☆\n\nEek!?\n(Wh— Wh-Wh-Who is this!? … Oh, now that I take a good look at him, it’s just Tenma-kun, from my class.)\n(No ordinary person is able to keep up with my ninja strides.)\n(... Well, Tenma-kun does do track and field, so his running speed is outstanding.)\n(More than that, at this rate I’ll end up having to race Tenma-kun! We may be classmates, but that doesn’t make us close.)\n(What should I do? Should I come up with an excuse to decline? But he went to the trouble of inviting me~? Uuu, I hate my lack of communication skills!)\n\nDash, dash, daaash…♪\n\nEh? T-Tenma-ku~n…?\n(Tenma-kun ran off and left me behind. It feels like once he breaks out into a run, he can&#39;t be stopped.)\n(It’s like he doesn&#39;t even notice I&#39;m not there with him...?)\n( — My fundoshi dropped to the ground. Tenma-kun’s entrance surprised me so much, I ended up stopped in my tracks.)\n(I’ll call it for today&#39;s training and see myself out quietly.)\nTenma-ku~n, I&#39;m going home.\nI’m happy you invited me but my training ends here.\n\n～……♪\n\n(Ough, my voice is too quiet, it doesn’t seem like he heard me at all! …Tenma-kun can’t help but have a blast when he’s running, huh?)\n(I’m the same way— I love ninjas so much I just can’t help myself, so I can kind of understand how he feels.)\n(... Yeah. I’d be a complete disgrace of a ninja if I gave up and went back home after one failure! I&#39;ll tie the fundoshi around my waist again and go back to training too!)\n\nHum, humhumm~♪ I knew I’d have fun getting a run in! The wind feels sooo good~\n\nDontcha think so too, Shinobu-chan~? … Wait, where’d he go? Shinobu-cha~an, answer me!\nI-I kept you waiting. You’re so fast, Tenma-kun, I had a hard time catching up with you. (Wheeze) Huff!\n\n\nUu~ I left you behind. I’m sorry that I didn’t notice.\nI just started running and couldn’t stop, yanno. It’s like bein’ in a car and slamming on the gas pedal.\nThere’s no brakes, so I just keep on running until I bump into someone. I get hurt a lot when I do that, but injuries are just the badge of honor of a man, right~...?\n\nOne time, I got so absorbed in my ninja training, I couldn’t get down from a tree~ I’m pretty sure they say it’s important not to get too absorbed into things.\n\nYou’re so smart, Shinobu-chan! I&#39;ll try running without getting too absorbed in it too.\nDash… Uuwhoa!?\n\nYou ran straight into a fence!? A-Are you okay~? If you’re hurt, let’s go to the infirmary!\n\nNahh, nothin’ a little spit can’t fix. (Spitting)...♪\n\nThat’s so primitive… I get hurt from ninja training too, but you shouldn’t underestimate injuries.\nThe both of us are idols, so it’d be a big deal if we left bumps and bruises on our faces, right~?\nAnyways, it&#39;s probably best to call the race here, Tenma-kun.\nIt looks like students are coming over here for their club activities. They’re in uniform and they’re coming in droves.\n\nThere’s no Track and Field Club activities today, so it’s probably a different club~? Uuu~ I didn’t get to go all out on running, so I feel all groggy.\n\nI’m gonna run to the school building. Wanna join me, Shinobu-chan?\n\nN-No, go on without me.\n\nThat right? Well, I'm off then~! Bye-bye~☆\nWait–! If you run around the school buildings, the teachers are gonna find out and get mad... Agh, he ran off before I could warn him.\n\nChapter 2\n\n    Location: Garden Terrace\n\n\n……\n(Ough, lunchtime at Garden Terrace is just as packed as usual, huh~)\n(I got my allowance, so I’m gonna splurge on some lunch here today! It put me in high spirits, but—!)\n(It&#39;s suffocating when it&#39;s this crowded.)\n(I didn&#39;t bring a bento, so if I don&#39;t eat, I&#39;ll have to go to the school store. It’ll probably be crowded there too, though, so...)\n(I might not even be able to get whatever bread is left over)\n(And I’m already in line for the ticket machine. That’s not to mention the question of finding a free seat, but I&#39;ll think about that after I buy my meal ticket.)\nUhyaa!? S-Someone just patted me on the back! But I&#39;m not the kind of person who has many good friends!\nAh, maybe they were reminding me not to step out of line? Pardon me, pardon me! I&#39;ll pay attention, so please forgive me~...?\nHuh? Transfer Student-dono? Could it be that you recognized me as an acquaintance and approached me? I&#39;m pleased~♪\nAre you here for lunch too?\nHmm. You forgot to make a lunch for yourself, so you thought you’d have something at Garden Terrace for once, and so you’re waiting in line for the ticket machine?\nI’m here because I have extra spending money. The portions at Garden Terrace are just so big, sometimes I can’t even finish it all.\nAnd so to prepare, I skipped breakfast today~\nThanks to that, I’m starving. I was on pins and needles in class wondering if my tummy would growl loud enough to hear.\nAnd since I couldn&#39;t really concentrate on the lesson, I ended up getting scolded by the teacher!\nKunugi-sensei&#39;s lectures are long. I was worried I’d be late and miss lunch.\nHuh? If I’ve decided what I want off the menu, you’ll put in an order for the both of us, Transfer Student-dono?\nHmm, I see. You’d rather I reserve a seat for us instead?\nOrdering is certainly only half the battle – if there’s nowhere to sit after you get your food, you’ll just be left searching around with a tray in your hand.\nUmm, does that mean you’d like to have lunch with me?\nEr— of course I don’t hate it or anything— far from it! If anything, I’d be more than happy to have you. I&#39;m so happy, I&#39;m jumping for joy! (Humming happily)~♪\nWell then, I’ll go hunt for some seats! The meals are in your hands, Transfer Student-dono~☆\n(Hm~m...? Well, it is lunchtime, so it’s a given all the seats are taken. Should I ask if we can share a table with someone?)\n(Ah, a seat opened up at just the right time! This gift from god— it’s mine~!)\n(Ahhhh, I was too late to it!)\n(Uuu~ I’m supposed to be a ninja. I don&#39;t have the qualification to call myself such if I lose a contest in speed. I’ll make sure to get the next one!)\n\n\nHaHa~♪ HiHi~♪ HaHiHuHeHo~...♪\nAhaha. Sora-chan’s in a good mood! I’ll sing with you too, HaHiHuHeHo~……♪\n\nMitsu-chan’s good at it~ Two’s better than one, the more people there are, the more fun it is~ Sing with Sora and dye the world with the colors of the rainbow! The colors of a rainbow are infinite~♪\n\n\nHm? And I was wondering why it was so lively. So it was Sora-kun and Mitsuru-kun, huh? Heyo~☆\n\nHuHu~ it’s Hina-chan! There’s a sweet smell coming from Hina-chan~ A bittersweet spring color, milk and strawberry… Is it shortcake?\n\nRight on the money~! Garden Terrace has tons and tons of cuisine, but I’ve always got room for dessert.\nAre you guys about to have lunch? If you can’t find a seat, wanna sit here?\n\nIt’d help a bunch, but is it really okay?\n\nWe just finished up. You shouldn’t hog seats when it’s so packed, so don&#39;t think twice about sitting.\n\nHeHe~ Sora shows his gratitude when he is shown generosity! Thanks~♪\n\nAhaha, don’t mention it.\nLook, Aniki. We ate so much that the table’s filled with plates. Don’t tell me you haven’t had enough to eat yet.\nWith how much we’ve gorged on, any more surely would be too much, right?\n\nWe’re in our growth period. No matter how much I eat, I’ll never be full~\nWell, I guess you know what they say, you should only eat up to being “80 percent full”…☆2\n\nWelp, we’ll be off, then.\n\nHina-chan, Yuu-chan. Bye-bye~ Until next time…♪\n\n\n…………\n\nMitsu-chan? Is something on your mind? Sora is following Mitsu-chan’s gaze!\nMm~ There’s a lot of people so everything’s all jumbled. Is that color Shinobu-chan’s?\n\nYeah, it’s Shinobu-chan. I thi~ink something’s wrong, he’s looking around all restlessly.\nIt&#39;s good he made it in time for lunch, but maybe he’s having trouble finding a seat?\nSora-chan. I’m gonna go flag Shinobu-chan down. I’ll put our orders in too while I’m at it. Whaddya wanna eat?\n\nHoHo~ Sora wants the omurice set! Omurice is packed with happiness~ Its fluffy and creamy roundness is absolutely delicious!\n\nAhaha, roger~☆ I'll dash on over and put the order in, so just wait a sec. Dash, da~sh...♪\nChapter 3\n\n(What do I dooo~? At this rate, I won’t be able to complete the mission Transfer Student-dono gave me!)\n(If I can&#39;t secure even a single seat, Transfer Student-dono will think I’m completely useless~!)\n(I can&#39;t afford to worry about appearances anymore. I have no choice but to beg for a seat using the dogeza Isara-dono taught me…!)\n\nShinobu-chan.\n\nHyeek!? Y-Y-You startled me~! Uuu, Tenma-kun, right? I thought my heart was going to stop! What business do you have with me?\n\nIf you&#39;re looking for a seat, how ‘bout you come eat with us Shinobu-chan!\n\nHuh? Is that why you went out of your way to come talk to me? You’re being kind to me because I was nervous?\nErrr, I&#39;m having lunch with Transfer Student-dono, so... I have to find seats for the both of us...\n\nTransfer Student Nee~chan? We‘re camped out on the sofas, so it should be alright! Tons of people could fit there, no problem~♪\n\nOver here, over here. Sora-chan’s waiting~!\n\nUwawa! Please don’t pull me by the hand! I feel like I’m gonna trip, awawa!?\n\nAaand~ We’re here! Sora-chan, Shinobu-chan’s gonna sit with us, so scoot, scoot!\n\n\nHaHa~ Sora will get closer to the edge! Come, come, wel~come~☆\nP-Pardon the intru~sion…?\n(Tenma-kun’s energy pushed me into sitting with him!?)\n(Well, I was having a hard time finding a seat, so this does help.)\n(I-Is it okay for me to be here? Tenma-kun and Harukawa-kun are my classmates, so this could be a chance for us to talk more!)\n\nOkay, I’ll go pick up our orders~...\nMfph!?\nOwowow… Hm? I’m so sorry, Transfer Student Nee~chan, I bumped into you! Are you hurt?\nThat was a close one? Ahh, Nee~chan’s holding a tray full of food.\nI managed to avoid bumping it when I ran into ya. What a relief, it’s safe~♪\nHm? Shinobu-chan? If you’re looking for Shinobu-chan, he’s sitting on the sofas, yanno. Sora-chan’s with him too~♪\nI&#39;m gonna go get the food I ordered. You guys can go ahead and eat!\n\nT-Transfer Student-dono~! Here, come this way, this spot’s empty~♪\n\n“Thank you for saving a seat for me”?\nNo, no! It’s not like I found it… Tenma-kun noticed me and came to invite me to sit with him and Harukawa-kun.\nIf it weren’t for that, I’d still be rushing around trying to find a seat.\n\nHiHi~, A happy-looking color is coming from Anzu! (Sniff, sniff) That smells delicious~\n\nCurry rice and lasagna? HuHu~ Sora got it right! The lasagna’s piping hot~ so be careful not to get burned!\n\nEh? I can pick out the things I like? Well then, I’d like some of the curry rice~♪\n\nSorry to keep you waiting! Here’s the omurice set for Sora-chan and a katsudon~\n\nHeHe~ It’s glistening, it looks delicious~♪ Oops, before eating Sora has to show his thanks! Hands together~ Thank you for the food…♪\nMe too, me too! Thanks for the meaa~al.\n\nTh-Thanks for the meal…\n\n(Munch, munch) This katsu’s so crispy and delicious! Want a bite, Sora-chan?\n\nHoHo~ Sora will eat it! Sora will return the favor too~ Take a bit of Sora’s omurice~♪ By all means, please have a bite, Mitsu-chan～☆\n\n(Hm? Tenma-kun and Harukawa-kun are pretty close, huh.)\n(I see them together in class a lot… Am I intruding?)\n\nShinobu-chan, Shinobu-chan.\n\nHuh? Were you talking to me? Not a different person with the same name…?\n\nAhaha, you’re so funny~ Aren’t you the only person here with the name “Shinobu”, Shinobu-chan?\nThere&#39;s something I wanna ask you, Shinobu-chan!\nI’m always seein’ you playing weird games like sticking to ceilings and climbing walls… the other day, I saw you hide in the supply closet!\nI thought to myself, “I wonder if Shinobu-chan’s playing hide and seek.”\nNext time, invite me too! I&#39;m better at running than hide and seek, but I still like it~♪\n\nNo, um, it wasn’t that I was playing hide-and-seek, though~...?\nIt was part of my ninja training. I was playing out an espionage mission, hiding in the supply closet to escape from pursuers.\n\nHmm. I didn&#39;t really get what an esspinach mission is, but…  it was hide-and-seek after all! Who was “it”? Someone from our class?\n\nNinjas are destined to live and die in darkness, so… just me.\n\nTwo is better than one, and three is better than two, yanno! Hide-and-seek is way more fun when you play with a bunch of people rather than just on your own!\n\nHaHa~, Sora agrees with Mitsu-chan too~♪ Sora also likes climbing walls and sticking to the ceiling with everyone~♪\nAhaha, Sora-chan’s definitely nimble too! He’s just like a ninja~♪\n\nNinja…? B-By any chance, do you two have an interest in ninjas?\nWhoa, I didn’t realize there were such people so close by! It’s always the things right under your nose that you miss!\n\nChapter 4\n\nNinjas? Oh~ there&#39;s a ninja as a playable character in one of Sora’s games~\nThey set traps to slow down enemies, and easily climb walls that the samurai can&#39;t~\nThe ninja is a secret character! You can&#39;t unlock it unless you clear all stages as a samurai~\nEven if an enemy approaches, ninjas can avoid battle by camouflaging with the color of the wall!\nBut it&#39;s not all benefits~ Ninjas don&#39;t have any combat ability, so if they’re seen by the enemy, it&#39;s Game Over!\n\nWhoa, that sounds fun! Is it one of the games at the Game Research Club?\n\nYes! The Game Research Club has lots of games!\nTime flies when you’re playing~ Make sure to limit playtime!\nOops, Sora got off topic~ What stuff does Shinobu-chan usually do? Please tell Sora~♪\n\nHmn~... Stuff like what I was telling Tenma-kun. Hiding oneself through Concealment techniques are just one aspect of ninja training.\nThe “Blazing Escape Technique” is another way to hide from the enemy, but... Training with fire will get you in huge trouble if a teacher finds out.\nWorst case scenario, the Ninja Association would be shut down.\nEven running in the halls will make them angry. It&#39;s a hard world for a ninja to live in.\n\nShinobu-chan, eat some tasty sweets to cheer up! Look, look, here’s a parfait, say aaa~aaa…☆\n\nFweh!? I&#39;m so full from all the curry I ate, so I&#39;ll just accept your feelings for now!\n\nReally? Well, I’ll go halfsies with Sora-chan then! Oh, do you want some too, Nee~chan?\nOh right, you had lasagna, huh. Guess you’re full too. You and Shinobu-chan don’t eat much, huh…~?\n\nAhaha, it’s just the menu at the cafeteria is huge... (Munch, munch, gulp). What a great meal~♪\nSo, are you guys really planning to join me for my ninja training?\n\n(Munch, munch)... Yep! I’ve always been curious about what Shinobu-chan does. If that’s ninja training, I’m in~♪\n\nHiHi~, Sora also wants to try something fun! Sora can’t wait for after school~ HaHiHuHeHo~...♪\nYay, I&#39;m so happy...♪ I can&#39;t wait for after school either~\n\n\n    Location: 1B Classroom\n\n\nHehehe, we’re all done with school!.\nWe’ll start ninja training right away, but...  If there&#39;s something you don&#39;t understand, please feel free to ask ♪\n\nQuestion!\n\nOhh, Tenma-kun! What is it? Heheh…~♪\n\nShinobu-chan, what’s that sheet you’re holding for?\nIt looks dirty, so you should ask Hajime-chan to wash it for you! Not even the most stubborn stains stand a chance against his hands!\nWhen pure white cloth gets stained from dirt, it’ll turn the color of that cloth Shinobu-chan’s holdin’... Was the color called ochre, or somethin’~?\n\nUmm, it’s always been that color, you know~\nIt&#39;s a sheet used for concealment techniques, so it shouldn’t be dirty at all. Please use it without any worry.\n\nConcealment? Now that you mention it, you said at lunch that you used a concealment technique to hide yourself? So the sheet’s used for that?\n\nThat&#39;s right. I’ve learned from past mistakes, so this time I’ve prepared a sheet of the same color as the floor.\nPull this over your head and poof! It will make it look like we’ve disappeared...!\nAnyways, seeing is believing! We’ll practice at the edge of the hall so no one accidentally steps on us.\nI’ll go first and show you how to do it, so please watch carefully.\nNinpou: Concealment Technique…!\n\nHaHa~ Shinobu-chan has vanished! Is it magic? Did he cast a spell?\n\nHmm~...? Ah, I see him! It’s hard to tell from far away, but if you look closely, there’s a weird bulge on the floor!\n\nOhh, so you’ve spotted me. But but! It wasn&#39;t immediately obvious! That’s a new record~♪\n\nAh! I got an idea!\nIf I had this sheet, I wouldn&#39;t have to worry when Kunugi-sensei’s after me I can just go into the first classroom I see, cover myself with the sheet, and I’d be off the hook!\n\nKunugi-sensei? That person’s glorious lectures go on and on. If you even think about falling asleep, he’s there in a heart-beat to wake you up.\nI was so surprised by his perceptiveness at the DDD, I’d wondered if he came from a bloodline of ninjas.\n\nI getcha. Even if I try not to get seen, he finds me right away! I don&#39;t like getting chewed out, so I try to make a break for it as soon as I can~\n\nHiHi~, Speak of the devil~? Sora can hear footsteps coming this way~ Is it Kunugi-sensei, maybe?\nEh!? I&#39;m toast if Kunugi-sensei spots me! He already got mad at me yesterday for running in the halls...\nI want a way to escape without being seen, whatever it takes!\n\nA way to escape from here without detection!? Mm~ Maybe if we used the “Wall-Climbing” ninjutsu...\n\nHuh? What’s that? If it’s a good way of doing it, please tell me!\n\nUmm, it’s a ninjutsu where you go out the window and scale along the outside wall like this. Still, it&#39;s a difficult technique for a beginner to try off the bat...\n\nHup! Like this?\n\nHuHu~ Sora is good at this sorta thing too! Sora will follow after Shinobu-chan and Mitsu-chan~♪\n(Whoa. Tenma-kun and Harukawa-kun&#39;s physical abilities are seriously unreal, aren&#39;t they? This stuff’s usually tough for beginners.)\n(But, escaping a pursuer by climbing a wall is so ninja-y, huh.)\n(Having friends who get to experience ninjutsu like this with me feels a little new and exciting— I can’t help getting giddy…!)\nTenma-kun, Harukawa-kun. Follow me! Behold: Ninpou: Wall-Climbing Technique, Ahhahahahaha…☆\n\nChapter 5\n\n(Peek, peek, peek… Which floor are we on?)\n(Anywho, I climbed like crazy to get away from Kunugi-sensei so I ended up outpacing Shinobu-chan and Sora-chan.)\n(I see the rooftop fence from here, so I gotta be on the third floor? If I managed to make it this far from the first floor already, I’m pretty sure I’m in the clear from here~♪)\n\n\n……\n\nEeya!? This guy’s scowling at me with a terrible look on his face! Umm, are you the megane guy from the student council?\n\nYou. You’re a first-year… You just came through a window instead of a classroom door, didn’t you? Does this mean you were climbing along the outer wall?\n\nThat’s right. ‘Cause Kunugi-sensei~ woulda gotten mad at me if he saw me.\n\nSo what you’re really saying is that you did something that warranted a scolding from Kunugi-sensei?\nScaling the wall into a third year classroom is certainly worthy of a lecture indeed!\n\nThat’s not it! I got scolded yesterday for running around the school…\nI haven’t done anything wrong today yet, I was running away from Kunugi-sensei~ ‘cuz it was a reflex, yanno!\n\nHow incorrigible. “I haven’t done anything wrong”? You were climbing up the school walls, that’s enough to be worthy of punishment.\nYou do know this is the third floor, don’t you?! What if your hand slips and you fall? Chances are things wouldn’t just end in injury…\nI think I’ll be giving you a thorough talking-to and straightening you out before I hand you over to Kunugi-sensei.\n\n\nHeHe~ Sora’s arrived~♪ Mn~... What a furious, stinging color~? Sora sees a really dejected color too!\nAh, Sora-chan! You saved me~ This guy was just ‘bout to lecture me!\n\nHoHo~ So the furious, stinging color was that person~\n\nHm? It’s getting more and more sharp~ The anger’s getting red hot! Is Sora gonna get lectured too~?\nThat’s right, you troublemakers. I won’t overlook you all and your dangerous behavior.\n\n\nTenma-kun, Harukawa-kun. I’ve arrived too~♪\nWow– both of your physical abilities are outstanding!\nI thought I’d catch up to you along the way, but you completely left me behind!\nThe two of you would be just splendid in the Ninja Association…- Oh?\n\n……\n\nU-Um. If I’m not mistaken, this doesn’t look like a good situation…?\n\nShinobu-chan, Sora-chan, make a break for it!!\n\nHaha~ a furious, stinging color means danger! Let’s all make a break for it together…♪\n\nI can sense something off in the atmosphere too~! I-I just got here, but there’s no other choice but to scale up the wall again!\n\nHey, hold it, don’t scale up the walls! Do you all hear me~!?\n… Mmn, I can’t see them anymore. Are those guys animals?\nIn any case, I can’t just sit here like this. Seems like they’re headed up to the rooftop, so I’ll catch them soon and give them a lecture they won’t forget.\n\n\n… Hasumi-kun? What’s wrong, you’re unusually frazzled.\n\nKunugi-sensei… As a matter of fact, I was just chasing down some first-years to warn them— they were doing dangerous things like scaling the wall.\n\nHm, there’s only a few students who have the physical ability needed to scale the walls of the school building. I have an idea of who they might be.\n\nThey said that if you found them, you’d get angry, so… I figured they might have done something wrong.\n\nWell, dangerous behavior within school grounds cannot be overlooked. Where did they run off to?\n\nI suspect the rooftop. There were three of them, all first years.\n\nThe rooftop, huh? Understood. I&#39;ll take care of the rest, so don’t worry about it.\n\nBut I’d hate to trouble you with this… I’ll find the ones responsible.\n\nYou have your own duties and practice to do, don’t you? I&#39;m in charge of student counseling, so it&#39;s my job to find and lecture them.\nLeave the rest to me. Understood, Hasumi-kun?\n\n… Yes. Well, then, I’ll leave it in your hands.\n\n(It&#39;s good to be full of energy, but there are limits.)\n(It would be a serious problem if other students imitated that behavior. Shall I rake them over the coals a little so they learn their lesson?)\n\n\nHaHa~ We got to the rooftop~ Sora doesn’t see any angry colors! We should be safe here, hm~?\nYou think so? That guy seems persistent.\nHe’s just like Kunugi-sensei~ Sensei~ hunts me down ‘til he gets to lecture me too, yanno. Please spare me~...\n\nUuu, I got scared and ended up running away, but... that person was the vice president of the student council, wasn’t he?\nDid we make an enemy out of the student council? If this gets the Ninja Association shut down, I’ll sob my eyes out~…!?\n\nChapter 6\n\nShinobu-chan, don’t cry… When it comes down to it, it was my fault. I was the one who asked to run away so Kunugi-sensei wouldn’t spot us.\n‘Cuz of that, we ended up being chased down by the student council megane guy... I&#39;m super, super sorry!\n\nTenma-kun…\nNo, please don’t apologize.\nWall climbing is just one type of ninja training... I was already thinking of moving on to it after I taught you the concealment technique.\nA prominent member of the student council set his eyes on us, and so we got scared and ran away… But the truth is, we still did something dangerous, didn’t we~?\nYeah! So let’s say we’re sorry properly. If we apologize with all our hearts, they might forgive us.\nYou can do anything if you set your mind to it. Nothing will be achieved if you don’t try~♪\n\n……\n\nSora-chan? You’re staring over at the entrance. Is the student council megane guy coming?\n\nHiHi~ Sora can see a furious, stinging color! And Sora hears footsteps too~ But it’s not the one from earlier~ They look similar, but it’s slightly different!\n\nEh? What’s that s’posed to mean? If it’s not the student council megane guy, then who could it be?\n\nTenma-kun.\n\nEeya!? That voice is… Kunugi-sensei~! Wh–Why is he here~?!\nHasumi-kun told me what happened. The school rules might not have “do not climb the walls” spelled out, but common sense should dictate it as unacceptable behavior.\nI’ll take responsibility in correcting you to ensure no other students follow your lead. You all should better prepare yourselves.\n\nUu~ This is dangerous too! Sora-chan, Shinobu-chan! Run away! Dash, da~sh…!\n\nHuHu~ Sora doesn’t want to be yelled at either~ Sora will run away with Mitsu-chan! Bye-bye~♪\n\nEeek!? I-I shall take my leave as well~!?\n\nGood grief… Those three are nimble. It’d be nice if they used those physical abilities for something that wasn’t so ridiculous, though.\nWell, whatever. Guiding naughty students is my job.\nShall I pick out a few places they’re likely to go and get ahead of them?\nIt’s time to teach them a lesson that just recklessly scattering and running is futile.\n\n\n♪～♪～\n(Heheh, no one seems to have noticed that Yuuta-kun and I swapped, huh~?)\n(If we change out our headphones and hairpins, I don’t even need to say “I’m Yuuta!” for people to mix us up.)\n(Even when I was taking Yuuta-kun’s classes~ the teachers didn’t even say anythiiing~)\n(I can copy Yuuta-kun to a T because I’m his big bro.)\n(And if I’m disguised like this, I’ll get to know things like what everyone thinks about Yuuta-kun, huh.)\n(Yuuta-kun’s having fun too, so I’ll stay as “Yuuta-kun” just a little longer…♪）\n\n\nHuh? Yuu-chan, yoohoo～☆\n\nThat’s… huh, Mitsuru-kun!? It’s dangerous to sucker yourself onto the ceiling like that, y’know~...? If a teacher finds you there, won’t they scold you?\nOr maybe I should ask, why are you up there? You’re not playing a game with someone, are you…?\n\nI’m not playing around, yanno! I’m hiding from Kunugi-sensei~!\n\nFrom Sensei…? You did something you shouldn’t have again, didn’t you, Mitsuru-kun?\nHe was after you yesterday too. You were running down the hall so fast it surprised me.\n\nHeHe~ Are you talking to Yuu-chan, Mitsu-chan?\nMm~ That’s weird~? It looks like Yuu-chan, but the way it’s colored… seems different?\nMm~ Mmm? Ah, Sora gets it now! HoHo~ This is Hina-chan~♪\nBut why is Hina-chan pretending to be Yuu-chan?\n\nEeek!? The wall just peeled away! And Sora-kun appeared out of nowhere~!?\n\nHaha~ So it was Hina-chan! Hina-chan calls Sora “Sora-kun”~ Yuu-chan calls Sora “Harukawa-kun~”\n\nAh man~... The wall peeling off threw me off so much I let my true self show through. You got me, Sora-kun~ One point for you ♪\n\nAre you two playing ninja, sticking to the ceiling and wall like that?\n\nHiHi~ Nope! We didn’t wanna get scolded by Sensei, so we’ve been running away from him~ If we get caught, we might not make it home today~ That&#39;s how mad he is!\n\nYou too, Sora-kun? Not just Mitsuru-kun?\nIf Sensei found out I switched places with Yuuta-kun, he’d probably get mad at me too~ Brrrr, just thinking about it’s scary!\n\nWell, join us in running away! We have to look for Shinobu-chan, too~ We lost him somewhere along the way.\nHinata-chan, have you seen Shinobu-chan?\n\nSorry, I haven’t. But, I see. If he got separated, it’s a cause for concern~ Alright, I’ll lend a hand too~ ♪\n\nAh, bad news! Sora can hear footsteps~ Sora and the others are gonna get captured at this rate. Run away, run away?\n\nOf course we make a break for it! Hinata-chan, Sora-chan, hurry, hurry! There’s no time to dawdle~!\n\nChapter 7\n\n……\n(Uuu, I got completely separated from Tenma-kun and Sora-kun~!)\n(The pressure of Kunugi-sensei’s presence made me flee. It will be no laughing matter if he catches me.)\n(There really might be a likelihood the Ninja Association gets disbanded…?)\n(I-If I apologize up front, he’ll forgive me, right? I mean, It’ll be a problem if he doesn’t~!)\n(Kunugi-sensei isn’t a demon, so if I just let him know it was all a part of my ninja training…)\n\n……\n\n(Hm? That figure is… Kunugi-sensei!? Wait a sec, I haven’t been able to mentally prepare myself for him yet~!?)\n(Uhhh, I need to hide! There… the fountain!)\n\n… Hm, I thought I saw Sengoku-kun, but it seems it was just my imagination.\n\n\n(H-... He left? Phew~... No, I can’t be relieved!? I have to accept my fate!)\n(Mnn..nnn~ a handwritten apology should be enough, but...)\n(I don’t want a lecture too. His sermons make me so sleepy I can’t stay awake~)\n(Still, I never would have thought my water escape ninjutsu would come in handy like this!)\n(The fountain is Shinkai-dono’s turf though, isn’t it~ He’ll definitely scold me for having entered without asking.)\n\n\nheheh, are you [soaking] in the water too, shinobu? doesn’t it feel good~? [water] is [life]...♪\n\nSh-Shinka… Blububub!?\n(Cough, cough) I just swallowed tons of water in surprise~!?\nMy tummy’s gurgling, I feel sick~...\n\nshinobu, are you okay? i am sorry, i surprised you.\n\nI’m so embarrassed, I got completely thrown off. The fountain is Shinkai-dono’s turf, so I’m sorry for coming in here without permission.\n\nhm~mm. i was not aware this was [my turf] though~...?\n\neveryone is hesitant to join me in the [fountain]. isn’t that [strange]?\n\nEr, everyone holds back because it’s hard to get a read on you, Shinkai-dono.\nUmm, but could I ask you something real quick, Shinkai-dono…? … Have you seen Tenma-kun and the others?\nI got separated from them, so I’m looking for them.\n\ni haven’t~ but, i did see a [teacher] though?\nspeaking of which, he was calling your [name]. shinobu, did you do something to make [him] angry?\nif so, you have to make sure you properly say [sorry], right~?\n\nI– It wasn’t right to run around trying to escape after all, huh… I vow to you that I will never run away again, Shinkai-dono. Where did he go?\n\nIt’s troubling for me to be sworn to, but… i feel like he went towards the [passageway].\ni was just floating in the [fountain], so i wasn’t looking very carefully~?\n\nNo, no, that’s more than enough. The staff room is under the passageway, so he might have returned there. I’ll go after him at once~!\n\nshinobu, don’t run in the [halls], alright~?\ni’ll stay here a little longer. the [water] is nice and cold, it feels so nice~\npuka, puka…♪\n\nChapter 8\n\nUmm, the staff room was next to the counselor’s room, right? That’s where Kunugi-sensei should be!\n\nSengoku-kun.\n\nHuh!? Weren’t you on your way to the staff room, Kunugi-sensei? You were loitering close to the wall, as if you were waiting to ambush someone…\nAs I thought, you really must be a descendant of ninjas, Kunugi-sensei!\n\nWhat kind of a joke is that? I was waiting for you. I saw you dive into the water fountain, after all.\n\nEh!?\n\nAnd so I was lying in wait for you here. Your physical abilities are quite impressive— this goes for Tenma-kun and the rest too.\nSo, I caught all of them this same way. I thought… I’d do the same for you.\nWell, it seems you’ve reflected on your actions, Sengoku-kun. I won’t drag you to the counseling room by the scruff, then.\n\nIs that so…? Tenma-kun and the others were apprehended…\nUm! I’m the one at fault here. I was the one who invited them to do ninja training! So Tenma-kun and the others didn’t do anything wrong!\nPlease set them free and allow me to take the blame instead!\n\nIt’s a wonderful thing to care about your friends, but whatever the reason behind it, they became equally complicit the moment they accepted your invitation.\nPlease don’t cause too much trouble. You’re all high schoolers, so you should know right from wrong by now.\nYou’re students and you’re idols. Take care not to forget that.\nIdols are in the business of being watched. If you are bashed for even the smallest thing, your career as an idol will be cut short.\n\n\nUuu~... Forgive me, please forgive me. I&#39;m fully prepared to pen a handwritten apology.\nI’ll try to bear with the lecture as best I can, so could you take a teeensy bit easier on Tenma-kun and the rest…?\n\nHonestly… I don’t have the heart to scold you if you beg at me with tears in your eyes like that. You’re absolutely drenched, aren’t you? Before anything else, change your clothes and go put them out to dry\nWhile I cannot allow them to get off scot-free, a handwritten apology will suffice.\n\nYaaay, I can’t thank you enough, thank you, thank you~! Kunugi-sensei’s really not all that scary a person after all~♪\nWhat is there to be so happy about? I only let you off with a handwritten apology this time because it seemed like you reflected on it.\nIf you get too carried away, I’ll confiscate those toys you hide under your clothes, okay?\n\nEh!? They’re not toys, they’re gear necessary for ninja training~...?\nBut, how did you know about them? Mnn~ what a mystery.\n\nAren’t you always taking them out and doing intensive training? Your eccentric behavior is just as noticeable as Tenma-kun&#39;s.\nIt’s unusual for you to not be on your own today, hm...?\n\nTh— That’s right…\nToday, two people told me they were interested in the activities of Ninja Association… I&#39;m always by myself so I&#39;m a little embarrassed...♪\n\nI’d prefer you not increase the number of people doing dangerous things, though.\nThat being said, it’s a good thing to have comrades.\n\nEhehe, it feels strange to be praised by Kunugi-sensei~\nToday was a failure, but if things keep up like this, more and more people will get interested in ninjas~♪\n\nLike I said, what’s there to be happy about? You’re about to get scolded.\nGood grief, I’ve really gotten too lenient on my students, haven’t I.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Fundoshi, loincloth↑ 80% full"},{"title":"The Child God of Machines","url":"/translation//child_god_of_machines/","content":"\n\n \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\n                \n                \n                \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Era\n                \n                \n                !!, ES 2nd Year of Establishment\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Proofreading\n                \n                \n                    310mc\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    Season: Spring\n\nChapter 1\n\n    Location: Seisoukan Courtyard\n\n\n\n    Spring, ES’s 2nd Year of Establishment.

I can’t say I’ve been downloading and playing so many new spring titles, I let the time to sleep slip away!)\n(I’ve been so wrapped up in gaming, I’ve been neglecting work…!)\n\nAhaha. Err, I just graduated from Yumenosaki too, so it feels like everything’s been rushing past me~? So that's why I can't sleep~?\nHmph. What, are you as delicate as you look?\nIf you wanted, I could teach you how to navigate the new life.\n\nEh? Navigate the New Life Fair?2 Yeah, that’s right, that was weighing on my mind! It’s like one big bargain bin of rare and unusual games that’d usually have crazy premium prices!\n\nWhat are you on about? Hmph, I don&#39;t know much about the games you like, but…\n\n(D-Did I give myself away? Is he gonna get angry?)\n\nThat’s exactly why I’d like your advice.\nHere. What do you think this is?\n\n? This…?\nEh, what’s this? There&#39;s a weird machine nestled in the shade of the trees.\nI-Is this a UFO that crash-landed?\n\nI’m not sure. I couldn&#39;t sleep, so I ran my supervisory night patrol shift and found this strange object.\nI couldn’t just ignore it, so I was trying to figure out what to do. How incorrigible.\n\nWhat could this be… It’s making all sorts of beep-boopy sounds, though. It’s so futuristic~ It’s like something out of sci-fi~\n\nOi, don’t touch it so carelessly. It could explode.\n\nI don’t think it’ll explode, though…\nAh, of course, I thought I’d seen something like this. I’m sure there’s a control panel here–\nMhm. Alright, I can get this moving.\n\nM-Moving? Is this supposed to be some giant robot that combines and transforms or something?\n\nI don&#39;t know about combining, but maybe it can transform?\nHere! Look, Hasumi-senpai, open~ sesame~♪\n\nWhy exactly are you getting excited about this? I see that at the end of the day, you’re also just “Trickstar”!\n\n\n……\n\nWh– the lid…? Opened and revealed what&#39;s inside! This is…?\n\n\nGood morning to you.\n\nEh? A–... Ahh, yeah… Good morning.\n\nWait, this isn’t the time for casual greetings! Why were you stored inside this strange, mechanical thing, you!? Are you some sort of alien? If Tsukinaga knew about this, he’d be thrilled!\n\nI’m not an alien of any sort.\nI’m sorry. I seem to have surprised you.\nI’m sleepy, so it’ll be a bother to explain, but… in this situation, I have no choice… but to do it.\n\nMy previous greeting was not accurate. For me it’s &quot;good morning,&quot; but… for you, I believe it’s the time to say &quot;good evening.&quot;\n\nEr, what are you on about?\n\nYou’re the kind of kid who goes at his own pace, huh?\n\nTo sum it up, I was turning in for the night here.\nThe bed in the room that was assigned to me wasn’t very comfortable.\n\nI see. So you were kept up late by something weighing on your mind like us?\n\nI wouldn’t say I was particularly worried about anything. I couldn’t sleep, so I brought the bed I use at home.\n\nB-Bed? You call this strange contraption your bed?\n\nYes. I’ve already checked with the dormitory rules, and I don’t believe that bringing furniture to Seisoukan is prohibited.\nHowever, its size is too big to fit inside the room… so that’s why I was sleeping outside instead.\nAs long as it’s on Seisoukan’s premises, It shouldn’t be against the rules to be sleeping in a tent or a sleeping bag in the courtyard.\n\nIt isn’t recommended to do that, though. Also, it may sound convincing with the matter-of-fact way you speak about it, but I think it&#39;s a bit of a stretch to call this strange machine a sleeping bag.\n\nChapter 2\n\nHaa… You don’t know anything, do you, Senpai?\nThis is the latest model of the sleeping device I developed– Called &quot;Snooze-Snooze Any-Time-Any-Place-kun.&quot;\n\nWhat&#39;s with the name? It sounds like a half-rate comedian.\n\n(Hasumi-senpai’s quick and snappy with the straight-man act… I should take a lesson or two from him.)\n\nIts name isn’t worth worrying about. I wasn’t the one who gave it that name.\nBased on the latest research in ergonomics, this bed is perfectly constructed to help anyone get an instant good night&#39;s sleep.\nOn top of that, its functions enhance the fatigue recovery you get during sleep by several dozen times. If you’re not sold on it, why not try it out?\nIt seems like you two had trouble falling asleep like I did. But if you use Snooze-kun (abbr.), you&#39;ll be asleep in no time.\n\nAh, I might be a little interested.\nEhehe. Even when I know I&#39;ll just use it once and let it gather dust in the closet, I still buy the latest gadgets on the market.\n\nAs long as there are curious customers like you out there, my job will survive.\n\nYour job? You’re here at Seisoukan, so aren’t you an idol like us?\n\nThat&#39;s more or less the configuration for now, but my main job lies somewhere else.\nCalling myself an inventor is a little dubious, but that&#39;s the kind of work I do.\n\nAh, I might have heard of you. I see, as I thought, you’re definitely that “Deus Ex Machina”3 guy, right?\n\nWhat? That sounds like the alias of someone who’s come down with a serious case of Chuunibyou.4\n\n(Wow, He really is incredible! That straight-man act’s top notch, please teach me your ways, Shishou!)5\n\nWhy are you looking at me with those sparkly eyes…?\n\nI didn&#39;t give myself that pseudonym, either. &quot;Deus Ex Machina” isn’t a very auspicious name, after all.\n\nMechanical god6, huh… You, could you actually be a robot skillfully crafted to look human?\n\nAhaha, that’s kinda the vibe he gives off.\n\n… I’m told that often.\nLet’s put all that aside. Why don’t you two try testing out this bed?\nAs an apology for making you worry, I will give you both the gift of a good night&#39;s sleep.\n\nAh, like I said before, I&#39;m definitely curious~♪ Do I just lie down here? And then sleep soundly until morning?\n\nO-Oi, hold on a second, Yuuki. Don’t be so careless–\n\nHup. (Shoves)\n\n\nUuwhoa!?\n(Wh-What the? I got pushed right in….!?)\n\nWhoawhoa, please don&#39;t flop on me, Hasumi-senpai, I’m getting squished! I think this bed was made for one person, you know!?\n\n\n— Good night, my seniors.\nRest in peace. If you do, you’ll completely forget this troublesome reality in its entirety. That I can guarantee.\n\n\n    Location: Makoto, Adonis and Chiaki's Room\n\n\n……\n(H-Huh? I-I was asleep? So it was a dream after all…?)\n(I had the strangest dream... But that’s right, it really was just a dream, yeah? It was a little too unrealistic after all.)\n(I had a strange conversation with a peculiar kid under the moonlight. It was a dream, so no matter who I’d tell it to, they’d just say &quot;so what?&quot;, because it’s that trivial of a story.)\n\nAhaha. I game so much, I’m bound to have some wacky dreams. I’d better stop trying to unravel such wild delusions and get back to reality—\n\nYuuki! Are you here!?\n\nUwaah, you scared me!? H-Hasumi-senpai? What’s the matter?\n\nYou, do you remember anything that happened yesterday?\n\nPardon?\n\nI figured, I thought it was a dream… A dream’s a dream, and my recollection of it is gradually fading to where I can’t remember, but…\nDidn&#39;t we see a weird contraption and a strange child last night?\n\nEr… No, but it was a dream, wasn’t it? But, huh, did you have the same one, Hasumi-senpai?\n\n\n    Location: Courtyard\n\n\n……\n\n(Nnn…~ I should’ve completely erased their memories by tampering with their cerebral nerves, but it looks like there were some parts I let slip through the cracks.)\n(It&#39;s far from perfect yet.)\n\n(If its results don’t meet the developer’s expectations– if it doesn’t perform like it’s supposed to– then it&#39;s nothing but a dud.)\n(Just like me.)\n\n(I suppose I can’t get this on the shelves. There’s still plenty of room for improvement.)\n\nhmmn… mnnm…?\n\nIs something troubling you?\n\n\n? yes, well, i like to [soak in water], but as expected, this [season] is chilly enough where i would catch a [cold] if i did.\n\nI see. Then, why don’t you try out the invention I have here?\nThis is called the “Piping Hot Whenever You Want Kettle-kun” —\n\n(Humans find things that mimic humanity to be uncanny.)\n(The uncanny valley… I want to overcome that too.)\n\n(I…—)\n(I am not... a machine.)\n\n? is something the matter~?\n\n… No. I’m sorry, every once in a while, there’s a malfunction.\n\n(For now, that is...)\n(But, someday surely.)\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \nTranslation Notes\n↑ In Japan, the fiscal year begins in April.↑ From what I can tell, a New Life Fair seems to be a sale in the spring, where second-hand or discounted goods — usually furniture or appliances — are sold for the new (fiscal) year. I'm guessing Makoto's talking about a seasonal Steam Sale-esque sale for video games here.↑ Deus ex Machina (lit. god from the machine in Latin) is a plot device where an impossible situation suddenly gets solved by an unexpected event or force. The term comes from ancient Greek theater, when actors who played gods were lowered into the scenes with machines (imagine them being hoisted in the air by a crane).↑ Chuunibyou (中二病, lit. middle school disease) is in essence, having a cringey middle school phase. Shinobu has a scout story named Chuunibyou.↑ Shishou (師匠 lit. master) is an honorific for someone who has mastered a craft.↑ This (機械仕掛けの神) is literally &quot;god of machines&quot;."},{"title":"Dominant","url":"/translation//dominant/","content":"\n\n\n    .preview-wrapper { /* in case jquery doesn't work */\n        display: none;\n    }\n    @media (max-width: 567px) { /* for NexT Mashiro: makes padding smaller on mobile */\n        .post-block {\n            padding: 5px 10px 8px !important;\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                Dominant\n                ドミナント\n                \n                    Start Reading\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Keito gives lessons to Tetora to help him study for a quiz.

If you eat too much of those, you’ll throw off your nutrition and your body will be worse off.)\n\n(Cooking for yourself is better for a balanced diet, but if you get busy with work and can’t make it home until late, that&#39;s difficult to do.)\n(And even then, if there’s nothing stocked up at all that you end up skipping a meal, your body will pay for it even more. There’s a lot of tough parts about this.)\n\nNow, what’s next…\n\n\n    Location: Seisoukan Commons\n\n\n\nI feel like I’ve heard this question in class before…?\n\nU~myu. There’s so many names of battles, I get ‘em mixed up all the time.\n\nUuu~um, I’m pretty sure the answer to this question was…\n\nOh, is that you, Nagumo?\n\nUwaa!? H-Hasumi-senpai! How long have you been standin’ behind me…!\n\nOnly just now?\n\nI-Is… that right? I didn’t notice at all ‘til you called out to me. So my training’s not all the way there yet either, huh…?\n\nDo you need to do stuff in the common room?\n\nAs you can see, I’m making the rounds to replenish the daily necessities. If tissues and consumable goods like that don’t get refilled, the people who use them will be inconvenienced.\n\nGuess it’s one of your jobs as dorm supervisor? So it was Hasumi-senpai who kept everything refilled and stocked up…\n\nEssentially. When I’m extremely busy, someone else notices and refills everything for me.\n\nReally? I didn’t know that at all.\nSo the dorm supervisor doesn&#39;t just help you find the remote control if it goes missing, or contact maintenance if there&#39;s a water leak...\n\nSetting aside contacting maintenance, I’d like for everyone to look for the remote control by themselves at least...\n\nEven so, this means that it&#39;s all thanks to Hasumi-senpai we can live here comfortably at Seisoukan!\nThank you for everything!\n\nNo need to thank me. As the dorm supervisor, it’s nothing more than an obligation for me to fulfill.\nThat aside, what are you up to? You seemed locked into whatever it was you were doing… hm?\n\nA textbook… and notes…? It can’t possibly be– are you studying!?\n\nAhaha… it’s embarassin’, but yeah, that’s right…\n\nNagumo. Are you running a fever?\n\n? What’s that supposed to mean?\n\nNo, sorry. It’s just, I can’t believe there was any possibility that you’d study out of your own volition, Nagumo.\n\nI get why you’d think that, but even I study at least!\n\nYeah, that appears to be the case indeed. Back when I was a student, I could never imagine you as someone who studied, but… I see. Does this mean you’ve grown up too, Nagumo?\nDid you have a change of heart or something? Perhaps because you’re now in the highest year in school, you’ve grown some self-awareness…?\n\nAh~... I wouldn’t particularly say that, no.\n\nHm? Really?\n\nAt any rate, it’s wonderful that you’re pursuing the path to knowledge like that.\n\nA-Ahaha… Yeah…\n\nThat being said, even though it’s only been a year since I graduated, seeing workbooks from those days makes me nostalgic.\nAhh, like this page. Trick questions are mixed in with the typical ones, and they’re unforgiving. They tripped up many, many people.\n\nSo it was the same for your class, huh, Hasumi-senpai? Lots of kids in mine got ‘em wrong too.\nWell, I didn’t get ‘em at all either~♪\n\nThat’s not something you should be smiling about…\n\nEven though it’s a trick question, you should be able to find the answer if you read the question carefully. For instance, if you look at this question...\nHm? Sorry. It seems I dropped a paper that was between the pages of your workbook.\n\nAh. That’s…!?\n\nThis is an exam sheet? … And the grade is…\n\n– Three points?\n\nAhh~ … Err, is that right…\n\n… What in the world is this grade, Nagumo?\n\nWell, I guess I got caught off guard real hard by the pop quiz at the beginning of the semester.\nUntil a lil’ while ago, I was busy with Supervillains…1 Since I was out doin’ stuff in Okinawa, I couldn’t really review anythin’ I learned from second year.\n\nWell… Even so, I think saying this grade’s egregious would be an understatement.\n\nUuu… There’s nothing I can say back.\n\n… To tell you the truth, the only reason I started studyin’ was ‘cause of that quiz.\nStudents with low grades hafta get retested at a later date...\n\nHmm. You’re not good at classroom learning, but you’re still studying voluntarily, so I can imagine this means that…\nIf you take the test and get a bad grade again, you’d be put at somewhat of a disadvantage?\n\nYeah, that’s right. From that day on, you’ll get given twice as much homework to do for the whole month…\n\n… I was impressed that you were studying on your own for once, but to think there was a reason like that for it…\nI admit that it’s just like you, but there goes all that reconsideration I had of you…\n\n(No. Nagumo felt a sense of crisis from these test scores and got motivated because of them.)\n(Nagumo would’ve never been able to do that before. His efforts to study should be commended.)\n\n(But… from the looks of things a second ago, can Nagumo really pass the makeup test?)\n(While there are many kinds of entrance exams where hard work isn’t rewarded, it’s not like that with normal tests.)\n(You just have to solve the questions and then review the parts you got wrong. If you truly deepen your understanding of the material, surely, the results will come in the form of grades.)\n\nNagumo. When’s the makeup test?\n\nEh? Er, I think it’s supposed to be next weekend…\n\n… Next weekend? That’s no problem then. My work’s only going to be in the mornings for a while.\n\nWhaddya mean, “no problem”? I can’t keep up with what you’re sayin’ at all…\n\nIt&#39;s simple. From today until the day of the makeup test, I&#39;ll tutor you.\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nUmm, so you’re gonna tutor me, Hasumi-senpai?\n\nYes. While I do think it&#39;s a good thing to concentrate on going through the material alone, if there&#39;s someone there who can explain the questions you don’t get, you&#39;ll understand it sooner.\nIt&#39;s only been about a year since I graduated from Yumenosaki Academy. If it’s content from when I was a student, I should be able to teach it no problem. I&#39;ve gone over it a few times in Keito Lecture as well.\n\nAh~ It’d definitely save me big time when we get to questions I dunno, but…\n\nWhat? I don’t think it’s a bad idea, but… is something troubling you about it?\n\nNo, that’s not it!\n\n(That’s not it, but…)\n(Last year, when Hasumi-senpai tutored me, he was really ruthless.)2\n(To be honest, I could endure it then ‘cuz it was just one day. But if that kinda treatment went on day after day ‘til we get to the day of the next test…)\n\n(... No way, no way! There’s absolutely no way! I just know for sure that I’m not lasting past day two!)\n\n(But when I think about whether I can pass the makeup test on my own… I don’t have high hopes for myself, I just know I wouldn’t manage it.)\n\n… gumo. Nagumo!\n\nWah!? What’s wrong, what made you shout so loud?\n\nI should be the one asking “what’s wrong?”. You seemed like you were brooding over something…\n\nN-No, it’s nothing!\n\n……\n\n… Sorry. It seems I put you on the spot with my suggestion.\n\nEh? No, I’m not really put on the spot or…\n\nNo matter the reason why you started studying on your own, I thought that I could help you study, but it looks like I was being overbearing.\n\nNo, that&#39;s not it! If anything, it&#39;s a really, really appreciated suggestion!\nIt’s embarrassin’ to admit this, but I don&#39;t think I’m gonna be able to pass the makeup test if I keep studyin’ on my own, so...\n\nIf it’s okay with you, Hasumi-senpai, I’d like you to tutor me!\n\nHm, now that you&#39;ve come to the point that you willingly want to learn on your own, I feel that you’ll be fine even if you don’t rely on me, but…\n\nIf that’s what you’re saying, I’ll give it my all too.\n\nOssu! I’d like you to tutor me without holding back for a single second, Hasumi-senpai!\n\nTrust yourself in my hands. I’ll make sure you get a good grade on that makeup test– no, full marks!\n\nNo, umm… I’m not askin’ that much outta you?\n\nIt’s settled, we shouldn’t waste any time getting set up. … Just give me a moment.\n\nHuh? What do you mean, get set up? I’ve already got all my stationary and workbooks with me~\n– Ah, he’s already outta here. Looks like he went upstairs to get to his dorm.\n\n… I have a really really bad feeling about this.\nI might’ve just made a completely hasty decision… maybe…\n\nI’ve kept you waiting.\n\nOhh… That was real fast.\n\nYou’re so motivated, I certainly couldn’t leave you hanging for long.\nNow then, let’s start studying at once. Go and sit in your seat.\n\nHold on a sec, Hasumi-senpai. What’re all these books on the desk for? There’s way too many of ‘em.\n\n…? These are workbooks I brought for you to solve?\n\nNo, I get that, but–! Isn’t this a ridiculous amount of books!?\nWhat’re you even plannin’ to do with that mountain of workbooks!? I wouldn’t be able to finish this even if you gave me half a year! Summer vacation homework doesn’t even compare to this…\n\nSettle down. The lesson’s already begun. No talking out of turn.\n\nNono! If things keep up like this, I’ll have to do a stupid crazy amount of problem sets!? There’s no shot, I don’t wanna do that!\nAll I want is to avoid getting a failing mark in the makeup test, y’know!!\n\nHow can you be so spineless? Studying the bare minimum and leaving it at that is just a temporary fix.\nThe next time a test rolls around, you’ll just panic again.\n\nYou’ve advanced to being a third-year, so now is the time to thoroughly review all that you learned in your second-year.\n\nOkay, sure, you could say that, but…!\n\nUuu… All I wanted was to avoid getting my homework doubled, but Hasumi-senpai’s workbooks are way, way more extreme, aren’t they?!\n\n(Sigh)… If you’re that insistent, then I&#39;ll narrow it down to these three books for today. Now you won&#39;t have any complaints, right?\n\nNo, that’s still way too much!? I don’t think I could finish even one of these books in a day!\n\nGahh! “I don’t wanna do this, I don’t wanna do that!” You’re the one who told me not to hold back and tutor you!\n\nThat’s true, but~! I didn’t think things would end up like this, y’know~!?\n\n\nHear, hear! Keito’s always way too strict!\n\nYeah, right?! Tell him!\n\nKeito’s the super stubborn type. If we back down here, we’ll never win for the rest of our lives!\n\n… Why’re you arguing with Keito anyway, Tetora?\n\nWe’re not arguing, Tsukinaga.\n\nWait a sec– Tsukinaga-senpai!? How long have you been here!?\n\n\n\nHahaha! We heard you two talking!\n\nAnd Mikejima too, huh? Hiding and eavesdropping people’s conversation is in poor taste, you know.\n\nIt’s not like that’s what we meant to do. The common room got noisy, sooo it just happened to be in earshot.\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nWhat an explosive situation! I was worried a huge argument was going on, what with all the loud voices and confrontation, buuut…\nI’m relieved to know my worries were unfounded.\n\nSorry. It seems I got a little too riled up.\n\nMe too… I’m really sorry for being rowdy.\n\nNaaah, I’m not bothered. It’s a good thing to be lively.\n\nBut they were fighting over something, right? From what I heard, I got the sense Tetora was being forced to study against his will.\n\nIt wasn’t against his will. At the end of the day, Nagumo was the one who asked me to tutor him.\n\nThat’s true, but I missed the part where he said I had to do tons of books’ worth of questions!\n\nCalm down, Nagumo. You seem to think there’s a lot of questions in this book based on how thick it is...\nLook. Every page has an explanation, so there’s not nearly as many questions as there are pages.\n\nIt&#39;s not a matter of how many questions there are or anythin’ like that. It’s just that you’re underestimating how stupid I am, Hasumi-senpai.\n\nWhat on earth is giving you the confidence to say that with your chest…\nDo you think you can get good scores with that kind of attitude?\n\nAs I said a while ago, you’d run into trouble in the future if you neglected your pursuit of knowledge now.\nIf you can’t study even after you enter society, your troubles won’t stop at routine exams.\n\nYou’re blowing things out of proportion, Keito. You don’t need to study to keep up with life.\nI barely went to class, and I didn&#39;t do much homework either.\n\nBut I&#39;m still living a good life like this~♪\nSo I think you don&#39;t have to be so studious.\n\nDon&#39;t forget, Tsukinaga, that while you think that, there are people who are tossed around by your carefree attitude.\nWhat’ll you do if Nagumo takes your opinions seriously and stops attending classes?\n\nNo, ‘course I wouldn’t skip classes…\nI think it’s just like Tsukinaga-senpai to live his life like that, though.\n\nWeeell, there may be people who can be really successful in life without ever needing to study like Leo-san said, but…\nNot everybody can. Only a handful of people can turn out the same as Leo-san.\n\nMost people go to school and spend their time taking classes. If even common sense eludes you, you&#39;ll have a hard time in society.\nA student&#39;s duty is their studies. That goes for us idols too.\n\nNo, Keito, you’re wrong!\n‘Cause the most important thing for students is to enjoy their springtime of youth!\n\nEnjoy their springtime of youth…?\n\nYeah! Your school days will pass before you know it! That&#39;s why you should prioritize the things you can only do while you&#39;re a student!\nIf you wanna study, you can do it after you graduate. Throw out your notes and go out on the town! And have as much fun as you can! Wahahahaha☆\n\nU~myu, I feel like Tsukinaga-senpai has a point, too…\n\nThat’s absolutely absurd… is what I’d like to say, but I admit that the time you have as a student is limited.\n\nBut absorbing yourself in your studies in the classroom and taking exams are crucial experiences you can only get from school life too.\n\nOn that point, I agree with Keito-san.\nThe best part about being a student is taking classes with everyone.\nI was always traveling all over, so I think I might have sooome regrets of not getting the chance to spend time with everyone back then.\n\nEh~? Just go to class or whatever when you feel like it.\n\nI had way more fun composing than doing that!\n\nAlthough, even though I say that, I&#39;m not feeling inspired in the slightest right now, so no melodies are coming to me at all...\n\nYeah. I said that the best part is the time you spend taking classes with everyone else, buuut just because you’re a student doesn’t mean you have to put your whole being into studying.\nOf course, knowledge is important, and if you have it, it may be useful somewhere, but...\nDevoting yourself to something you enjoy like Leo-san does is another meaningful way to spend your time.\n\nBesides, sometimes random trivia ends up more handy than what you learn at school if we’re talking about knowledge that’s useful in the future. At the end of the day, it juuust depends.\nNot studying doesn’t mean you’ll have tons of trouble. I don’t think there’s any need to think too deeply about it, yeah?\n\nIf you wanna, how about you join up with us on our outing, Tetora-san? I was actually planning to go for a drive with Leo-san, so…\n\nEnough, Mikejima. Nagumo’s so lost he&#39;s at his wit’s end.\n\nU~myu. So I don&#39;t need to study after all...?\n\nNo, that’s definitely not the conclusion here…\n\nMikejima and Tsukinaga certainly have a point. I believe that a student&#39;s duty is to study, but I&#39;m not saying that you should neglect everything else in favor of just that.\nWe covered a lot of ground, but we should define your goal in why you want to study before anything else.\nIn Nagumo’s case, his first priority is to get a good score on the makeup test and keep his homework from increasing, am I correct?\n\nYeah… Exactly.\n\nSo if that’s what we’ve decided, then all we have to do is study the test material. Even though I’ve put some problem sets together, there’s no penalty if you can’t get it all done today.\nJust fill out as much as you can, Nagumo. There&#39;s still plenty of time until the makeup test.\n\n… Ossu. Got it. Like Hasumi-senpai said, we gotta start reviewin’ for the test.\n\nWell, if Tetora’s okay with that, it&#39;s okay with me too.\n\nYeah. Tetora-san’s really motivated, so we shouldn&#39;t disturb him any more than we already have. We were just about to head out, right, Leo-san?\n\nYep. Well then, maybe I&#39;ll buy some souvenirs for Tetora~♪\n\nChapter 4\n\n    Location: TV Station Lounge\n\n\n    A couple days later\n\n\n\n(Sigh) It’s just about that time, huh…?\n\nIt was nice working with you at the photoshoot, Nagumo.\n\nAh, Otogari-senpai. It was nice working with ya today!\n\nI never thought you would be here for this job.\nThe photographer also spoke highly of you, Nagumo. He said that your image was just right for this magazine.\n\nNo no, that should be my line. I saw your photoshoot first, so it gave me a general idea of what I should be tryin’ to do.\nYou got the okay right away too, didn&#39;t you, Otogari-senpai? I got nervous ‘cuz my turn came quicker than I thought.\n\nBut thanks to that, the shoot finished earlier than expected.\nActually, my seniors are on a TV show today. I was worried work would keep me from getting there to watch on time, but if I go home now I&#39;ll have plenty of time.\n\nYeah, the shoot really did finish quickly, huh~\n\n… (Sigh)\n\nWhat’s the matter, Nagumo? You’re sighing.\nDid you not want the photoshoot to end?\n\nAh, sorry. It’s not that, really…\nThe photoshoot ended quickly, so I hafta go back to Seisoukan…\n\n…? You don’t want to go back to Seisoukan?\n\nWhen I get back to Seisoukan, I hafta meet up with Hasumi-senpai to study together… but even though I’m the one gettin’ tutored, I&#39;m a li’l reluctant.\n\n\n\nHasumi-senpai… Ahh, I believe you’ve been studying like mad in the common room, right?\nI heard that rumor from Sakuma-senpai.\n\nEh? That’s a rumor?\n\nYes. It seems some people are talking about staying away from the common room so they don&#39;t get caught up in the study session.\n\nReally!?\n\nBut that’s true... I could sorta tell that whenever we’re studying, not many people came by the common room...\nIt makes sense if that was all ‘cuz everyone was trying to avoid Hasumi-senpai…!\n\nBut, what makes the study session so depressing? Being tutored is something to be grateful for, isn’t it?\n\nThat&#39;s definitely true.\nIf I have a question about something I don&#39;t understand, Hasumi-senpai will explain all of it to me, so I definitely learn a lot more than if I did it alone.\n\nBut I still can&#39;t get used to sittin’ at a desk studyin’ all the time. It’s not like zen meditation, I can&#39;t concentrate really well.\n‘Cuz of that, just the thought of studying as soon as I get home bums me out.\nWouldn’t doin’ nothing but studying every day get hard on you too, Otogari-senpai?\n\nHm, I&#39;ve never really found studying a difficult task, but... If I was always studying the same way you mentioned, I might get sick of it\nI want to also work on singing and dancing, and I want to cherish the time I spend with my friends and everyone in my unit, too.\nIt is frustrating that studying takes away that time from me.\n\nSo Otogari-senpai likes studying...\nI&#39;m not a fan of it. I prefer movin’ my body around way more.\n\nI like moving my body around too.\nBut I&#39;m from a foreign country. So there&#39;s still a lot I don&#39;t know about this country.\nThat&#39;s why I’d like to know as much as I can, and it makes me happy when I’m able to make use of what I’ve learned.\nIn that sense, I might not hate studying as much as you do, Nagumo.\n\nMake use of what you’ve learned, huh?\nI think you’re amazing for thinking like that, Otogari-senpai.\n\nI&#39;m no good at it... When I hafta sit still at a desk, my body just starts itchin’ to do somethin’.\n\nThey say that everyone’s cut out for different things. Like you said a second ago, you’re just better suited to physical activity, Nagumo.\n… If you&#39;re that worried about it, why don&#39;t you talk to Hasumi-senpai?\nIf studying takes up too much time or solving so many problem sets is challenging, I think you should speak with him honestly about it.\n\n(I&#39;ve already said it a few times, but... it feels like Hasumi-senpai understands how I feel, and doesn’t at the same time~)\n\nYou’re right. When I get back, I’ll try talking to Hasumi-senpai ‘bout it.\n\n\n    Location: Seisoukan Common Room\n\n\n\nThere we go. Everything’s all set up.\n\nOop. Keito-san’s special lesson hasn’t started yeeet?\n\nMikejima? It seems Nagumo had a magazine photoshoot today, so I got a message saying he’d be late.\nBut thanks to that, I could get far more materials prepared than usual.\n\nHahaha. Problem sets, a whiteboard, sticky notes and a new textbook. Seems like you’re real prepared alright.\n\nNot just that. I’ve also got these — they’re printouts I made myself.\n\nA homemade printout from Keito-san~? Tetora-san suuure is loved~♪\nIf you’re interested, would you like to try working on them too? Luckily, I made plenty of extras.\n\nIt&#39;s a nice offer, but I&#39;ll have to pass. I’ve got errands to run, so I’m going out for a bit.\n\nBut Keito-san, it seems like you&#39;ve been spending a lot of time studying with Tetora-san lately. Are you doing alright with work?\n\nThere&#39;s no need for you to worry about it. I’d be getting my priorities backwards if I worried so much about Nagumo that I neglected myself.\nThankfully, all of my work this week is done by morning. No job sites will continue into the evenings.\n\nHahaha! I was a little worried about you at first, Keito-san– It felt like you were getting fired up about teaching Tetora-san, buuut looks like I was just sticking my nose in places it didn’t belong.\n\nFired up about teaching…?\n\n… Hah, maybe so. I could tell I was getting a little passionate.\n\nI&#39;ve tutored Nagumo in the past, but...\nI suppose he has a certain disposition to him, and well — He didn&#39;t seem to be good with classroom learning.\n\nBut this time around, Nagumo was grappling and trying his best to study on his own volition… And that made me a little happy to see.\n… So perhaps that’s why — As a senior, I wanted to be someone he could depend on. For Nagumo’s sake, who started to realize the importance of studying.\n\nI see. So thaaat&#39;s why you were so motivated, huh—\nI get how you feeel~♪ Mama feels moved by the growth of all the kids too...☆\n\nDon’t lump me in the same group as you… Good grief.\n\nThat aside, didn’t you have things you needed to be doing?\n\nOhh, that’s right! Well then, I’ll be off!\n\n\n\n……\n(Hasumi-senpai… So that’s how deeply you thought about it.)\n\n(And here I am, doin’ nothing but whinin’ about how tough my studies are...)\n(That&#39;s not manly of me at all.)\n\n(... But I still feel like it’d be better if we could cut down on the study time…)\n\n(No! Don’t be a whiner, Nagumo Tetora! I&#39;ll answer Hasumi-senpai&#39;s feelings!)\n\nAl~right, let’s do this~!\n… Hm? You’re back, Nagumo?\n\nOssu! Nagumo Tetora, coming right in!\n\nHah, you’re even livelier today.\nI’ve made a special printout for you today. If you can solve this, you&#39;ll surely get a good score on the makeup test.\n\nGot it! Lookin’ forward to workin’ with you again, Hasumi-senpai!\n\nChapter 5\n\n    Location: Park\n\n\n    A couple days later\n\n\n\n(Aaalrighty, I managed to get here on time)\n\n(Is Leo-san waiting up for me? I hope he didn’t forget we were gonna go to the aquarium...)\n\nHm, over there is…\n\n……\n\nHeeeey! Leo-saaaan! Sorry I kept you waitiiing~♪\n\nWawaa, hold on, Mama! Don’t cradle me out of nowhere, I’ll be found out!\n\nHahaha! I&#39;m just happy you were waiting at the meeting spot~♪\nI figured there was a chance you’d find something interesting and go after it.\n\nSomething interesting? My head&#39;s been all foggy lately, so if anything, it’d have been better if I’d just found something like that.\n\n… Well, actually, maybe I did, kinda? I don&#39;t feel like it’s giving me any inspiration yet though.\n\nBy that, you mean you found something interesting? Now that I think about it, when I grabbed you, you diiid say something about being found out.\n\nYeah. Look, Mama, over there in the park.\n\nHmmm? That’s…\n\n\n\n……\n\nTetora-san? What’s he doing in a place like this?\n\nHe was staring out at the ocean long before I got here. Since he’s in his uniform, I figured he was on his way back from school, but it doesn’t look like he’s here to meet anyone either…\n\nHmm, maybe he’s just taking a detour then? Even so, he’s got a pretty glum look on his face.\n\nSo he’s taking a detour he doesn’t really want to? It’s kinda like a riddle, it’s worth fantasizing over...♪\n\nHmm… Now that I know about it, I can’t just leave him be. Let’s try hearing a biiit about it.\n\nOoi, Tetora-saaaaan!\n\n… Ah, Mikejima-senpai. And Tsukinaga-senpai too.\n\nAn odd, serendipitous reunion! I didn’t think we’d be meeting you in a place like thiiis!\n\nI got it! Tetora’s got a broken heart! And that’s why he’s sitting here on his own all melancholic?\n\nHuh? Whaddya mean broken heart?\n\nHahaha. Seems like that miiight not be it, Leo-san.\nBuuut I get why Leo-san would think that. ‘Cause something seems to have you down today, Tetora-san.\nIf you’re hungry, come grab some lunch with us...✩\n\nAh~... Sorry. I’m not that hungry or anythin’. It’s just that I don’t wanna go back to Seisoukan…\n\n… The political reforms introduced by the 8th Tokugawa Shogun Yoshimune were called the “Kyouhou Reforms”.\n\nHuh? What’s with you all of a sudden?\n\n? What?\n\nErm, like, why’d you just rattle off trivia outta nowhere? We didn’t ask anything about that…?\n\nTrivia… Did I say somethin’ just now?\n\n… When heat is applied to solid matter, it melts into its liquid form. That’s called “liquefaction”.\n\nThere! You did it again just now!\n\n(He’s subconsciously reciting facts, and they sound like things he’d learn from class. Which means, I have a feeling that the reason Tetora-san feels this way is because…)\n\nTetora-san, you don’t wanna go back to Seisoukan because you don’t want to study, riiight?\n\n… You’re amazing, Mikejima-senpai.\n\nThat’s exactly right. Just knowing that Hasumi-senpai’ll be lying in wait for me if I go back makes me kinda…\n\nYou’ve been studying in the common room every day? If that’s true, that’s seriously amazing of you!\n\nAhaha… Even I’m surprised I’ve made it this far.\n\nBut I’ve been studying for days on end, so… Just yesterday, I had a dream that I was workin’ on problem sets with Hasumi-senpai.\n\n… In polynomials, terms with the same letter are called &quot;like terms&quot;.\n\nI don&#39;t even wanna think about having dreams where Keito makes me solve problems. I&#39;d rather stay up all night.\n\nHow about you suspend today&#39;s study session? Looking at you now, it seems like your daily life’s being affected by your studies, Tetora-san.\n\nI thought ‘bout that too, but... I can&#39;t get myself to bring it up when Hasumi-senpai’s right in front of me.\nThe whole reason I&#39;m studyin’ in the first place is to get a good grade on the makeup test.\nSo it’s hard to ask him to stop when I was the one to ask for it in the first place…\n\nHm~mm. I get what you’re saying, but I don&#39;t think Keito wanted to make you into a fun-fact machine, y’know?\n\n(He’s been studying nonstop when he isn’t used to that routine, and on top of that, he&#39;s stressed that he can’t talk to Keito-san about it, so now he&#39;s like this.)\n(If Tetora-san explained the situation, I think Keito-san would stop with the study sessions, buuut… he probably doesn&#39;t wanna disregard Keito-san&#39;s kindness.)\n\nIf you can&#39;t tell Keito the truth, you’ll have to put up with it until the makeup test. But can you really keep up with studying with him?\n\nThat&#39;s... something I’ll fight through one way or another.\n\n… The sound of the bell at Jetavana Monastery echoes “all things will pass”!\n\nHm~m. Well, if Tetora’s alright with it, then I also think it’s fine as is…\n\nActually, I&#39;ve seen a character in a commercial before that rattles off trivia just like this~♪\n\nI wanna respect Tetora-san&#39;s feelings, buuut… As a Mama, I don&#39;t wanna leave a kid all alone when he’s suffering.\n\n…. Hmm. The purpose of the study sessions was for Tetora-san to get a good score on the makeup test, riiight?\nSo as long as Tetora-san’s gaining knowledge, Keito-san doesn’t need to be the one to teach it.\n\n\n\n… If that’s the case, Mama has a greaaat idea.\n\nErrr, whaddya mean?\n\nPlain and simple! I’m saying someone can just take Keito-san’s place as your tutor, Tetora-san.\n\n\n    Location: Seisoukan Common Room\n\n\n\n… He’s late.\n\nHasumi-senpai, do you have a study session with Nagumo today as well?\n\nOtogari? That was the plan, but Nagumo hasn’t shown up yet. He doesn’t have any club activities today, so I thought he&#39;d be back right after school...\n\nThat&#39;s concerning. Maybe something urgent came up?\n\nIf that’s the case, then it’d give me a peace of mind if he could just send me a message or something.\n\nIf I’m not mistaken, the printouts you have there are...?\n\nThat’s right. I&#39;ve made some new review worksheets. I feel the questions I put together hit it right out of the park, even for me.\n\n(Homemade printouts from Hasumi-senpai? If you’re able to solve them, they’d likely deepen your understanding of the material, but there seem to be quite a lot of pages...)\n(I can see how the thought of having to solve these might be a little depressing...)\n\nHasumi-senpai, these printouts…\n\n… Hold on Otogari. – I think I’m getting a call from Nagumo…?\nHello. Nagumo? Where are you right now?\n\n“O-Ossu. Hasumi-senpai. Um, right now I’m…… Ah!”\n\nHuh? What’s wrong, what happened?\n\n“Hiii, is this Keito-san? I’m on the phone right now– It’s eeeveryone’s Mama ☆”\n\n… Mikejima. Why are you with Nagumo?\n\n&quot;I’ve got my liiittle reasons. Actually, there&#39;s sooomething I need to tell you, Keito-san.&quot;\n&quot;Sorry, but... I&#39;m gonna be taking over as Tetora-san’s instructor from here on out.&quot;\n&quot;— Which is why as of today, Tetora-san is no longer Keito-san&#39;s student, but miiine~♪&quot;\n\n… What’s the meaning of this, Mikejima?\n\n&quot;And so, that&#39;s why there won’t be a study session today. Please put away your study materials and take it easy, Keito-san...☆&quot;\n\nWait! This conversation isn’t over! Oi, Mikejima!\n\nChapter 6\n\n    Location: AOUMI Aquarium\n\n\n\nWahahahaha ☆ There’s loads of fish! Which is the rarest in the whole aquarium? Don&#39;t hide, come out~♪\n\nHahaha! I’m glad to know it&#39;s made you happy, Leo-san.\nBut if you’re too noisy, the rare fish might not turn up, riight? The fish aren’t going anywhere, so let&#39;s take our time looking around.\n\nSure, got it! … Ah, it looks like there’s river fish in the tank over there!\n\nLeo-san’s in reaaal high spirits, huh? Looks like it was the right choice to bring him to the aquarium.\n\nWell then, we don’t wanna get left behind, sooo let&#39;s go after Leo-san, Tetora-san...☆\n\n… Ossu.\n\nWhat’s the matter, Tetora-san! You’re not a big fan of aquariums?\n\nThat’s not it…\n\n(... Hmm, looks like he&#39;s worried about Keito-san&#39;s study session getting canceled alright.)\n(Tetora-san’s a serious kid, after all. He&#39;s probably worried about letting down Keito-san.)\n(Even though it’s not something he should be worrying about… I&#39;m the one who compleeetely shoved aside the study session he was gonna have with Keito-san.)\n\nSorry for doing something without asking you first, Tetora-san.\n\n… No, it’s not your fault, Mikejima-senpai. The reason you told Hasumi-senpai there was no need for a study session was for my sake, right?\n\nIt’s my fault for finding the study sessions with Hasumi-senpai so tough.\n\nIt&#39;s not good to blame yourself too much, y’knooow? It&#39;s tough to force yourself to like something you hate.\nThat aside, you&#39;ve spent the past few days studying, right? Today, you should let your hair down as much as you like!\n\n……\n\n(But for Tetora-san, it doesn’t seem easy for him to just move on from it.)\n\n(Well then, what should we do here… I didn’t think it’d be good to just let him go to the study session, but on the other hand, there’s no point taking him out if he’s gonna keep feeling this way...)\n\nMikejima-senpai, a moment ago, you said that I’ll be your student, right?\n\nHmm? Yeah, Tetora-san and Leo-san are my students todaaay~♪ A “Madara Lecture”, in other words.\n\nLecture… so I’m gonna study after all?\n\n… Hahaha! Glad you asked! Of course, Madara Lecture has things to study too!\nBut, we’re not like Keito-san’s study session where you sit at a desk and study all deadly serious. After all, you can still study outside the classroom\n\nStudy outside?\n\nYep! Madara Lecture’s lesson has already begun, Tetora-san...☆\n\nWhaddya mean? We’re just walking around looking at the water tanks, though…\n\nYou two are so slow! You were still just standing here?\n\n\n\nLook, there&#39;s a beautiful fish over there! You check it out too, Tetora!\nI didn’t expect so many fish to have such flashy colors. I wonder why that is?\n\nMaybe they’re a bunch of showoffs? Since if they&#39;re this brightly colored, they could easily be found among the wide open sea.\n\nWahahahaha! This one’s opening and closing its mouth. It looks like it&#39;s breathing~♪\n\nHmm? But I&#39;m pretty sure fish breathe through their gills. Does moving their mouths have something to do with it?\nIt could be that, or… maybe it’s not breathing but speaking a language that only fish can understand? I think dolphins were the type to do that or something.\n\nHm~mm, I’ve got no clue at all…☆\n\nYou were right on the mark; it opens and closes its mouth ‘cuz that’s how it breathes.\nGill respiration starts when it breathes in the water through the mouth. Then, the fish gets oxygen when the water filters out through the gills — That’s what I’ve heard.\n\nOh? That was really thorough. Is that another thing you learned from studying with Keito?\n\nNah, Shinkai-senpai taught me that.\n\nHahaha! Kanata-san knows a lot about the ocean and fish, after all!\nOkay, Tetora-san. What about migratory fish like tuna?\n\nUmm... They can’t move their gill covers, so to breathe through their gills, they don’t stop swimming, right?\n\nThat’s the riiight answer, alright. Looks like Kanata-san taught you well~♪\n\nIf they always have to swim in order to breathe, does that mean they’ll die if they stop swimming? ‘Cause then they can’t breathe?\nSo they can&#39;t get sleep. Are they just always awake?\n\nThat’s a good point, now that you mention it.\n\nYou brought up a gooood question, Leo-san.\nDon&#39;t worry. Migratory fish get their sleep by alternating between their right and left brains. When they&#39;re asleep, they breathe while swimming more slowly.\n\nThey can rest half their brains at a time!? That&#39;s amazing! If I were a migratory fish that could breathe with gills, I could compose as much as I wanted without having to sleep...!\nI&#39;m feeling a little jealous of the fish all of a sudden...\n\nAh. But how am I supposed to write music underwater!? What should I do, Mama!\n\nTsukinaga-senpai’s not a fish either way, so I dunno if it really matters.\n\nHahaha! You have some reaaally interesting ideas, Leo-san.\n\nAaanyways, it&#39;s a good thing to raise questions like that.\nThe world’s overflowing with aaall sorts of phenomena and the laws that describe them. Raising doubts about why things are the way they are is how the learning process starts.\nSo if you&#39;re going to learn, you might as well have fun with it. There’s only so much you can learn by studying, no matter the hardships.\n\nThat&#39;s true. Maybe there will be times when you have to go through hardship a little, but… It&#39;s still better to have fun anyway.\nSo don’t wear that dull expression forever, Tetora.\n\n… You’re right.\n\nI can&#39;t keep looking gloomy all the time. Mikejima-senpai and Tsukinaga-senpai went out of their way to bring me to the aquarium, after all.\n\nWell, I guess marine biology isn’t in the scope of Tetora-san&#39;s test, though.\n\nBut there’s nooo need to worry! ♪ Madara Lecture will not betray its students!\nLiiike I said before, all Tetora-san needs to do is get a good score on his makeup test.\nThat being the case, I’ve got a veeery special technique just for you…☆\n\nSpecial technique? Tell me, please!\n\nThe reason you’re getting bad test scores is because it’s got questions you don’t understand. So coming at it from the other angle, if you know what everything is before the test, you’ll get a good score.\nIn other words— all you have to do is sneak into the academy and steal the test’s question sheet~♪\n\nChapter 7\n\n    Location: Seisoukan Common Room\n\n\n    Meanwhile, a few hours prior\n\n\n\nWait! This conversation isn’t over! Oi, Mikejima!\n\nGh. He hung up.\n\nHasumi-senpai. Did something happen to Nagumo? I believe I heard you say Mikejima-senpai&#39;s name too…\n\nI don&#39;t really get what&#39;s going on either, but...\nThat Mikejima. He said he’d be taking over Nagumo&#39;s tutoring completely.\n\nIs that… to keep Nagumo from meeting up to study with you?\n\nWho knows. I don’t have a single clue what he gains from disrupting Nagumo&#39;s studies.\n\n(And even if I wanted to bring Nagumo back, I have no clue where he is.)\n(If he was intercepted on the way back from the academy, he could be somewhere on that path... We could search with a fine-tooth comb, but it’d be hard to find him.)\n\nWhat a needless situation to be put in! There’s only a few days left until the makeup test…\nHow’s he going to take responsibility for this if Nagumo fails it? It&#39;s inexcusable!\nI never thought you&#39;d be the kind of man who’d waste other people&#39;s efforts, Mikejima...\n\n……\n\nI feel the same as you, Hasumi-senpai.\n\nYeah. … When Mikejima gets back, I’ll have to rake him over the coals as hard as I need to.\n\nNot that. I don’t think Mikejima-senpai is the kind of man to trample on people’s efforts.\n\n… What do you mean? Do you mean to say that you know why Mikejima got in the way of our studies?\n\nNo, I don&#39;t.\nBut... There&#39;s something I want you to know about Nagumo.\n\n\n    Fade out.\n\n\n\nHe was worn down by the daily study sessions… That’s what Nagumo said?\n\nYes. He seemed like he was struggling to keep up with studying every day.\nNagumo said that he didn&#39;t like studying in the first place, so your lessons might have been a burden to him.\n\nSo essentially, Mikejima couldn’t just sit back and watch when he saw how troubled Nagumo was, and separated him from me, the source of it…\n\n… We won’t know the truth unless we ask Mikejima-senpai.\n\nTrue. Or there’s a likely chance that it wasn&#39;t Mikejima’s decision, but Nagumo’s if he asked Mikejima himself.\n\n...I guess I shouldn&#39;t have interfered from the start after all.\nI thought I could help Nagumo somehow, seeing how motivated he was, but...\nIn the end, all it did was discourage him. How shameful.\n\nDon&#39;t blame yourself.\nThe study sessions might have been discouraging for Nagumo, but…\nEven then, he was grateful to you for being his tutor.\nNagumo said he was learning a lot more than if he’d studied on his own. Please understand that those are his true feelings too.\n\n… Even if that’s the case, the truth is inevitable: I backed Nagumo into a corner. That was my mistake.\nIt looks like I got a little too passionate about tutoring him…\n\n(But if the way that I tutored him wasn’t working for him, he should’ve said something…)\n\n(No, he’d actually been saying it from the start. It’s because I didn’t take him seriously that things turned out this way.)\n(Nagumo had finally gotten motivated, and I came in and carelessly squashed it.)\n\n… Thank you for explaining the situation to me, Otogari. I’m sorry for causing you trouble.\nIf Nagumo doesn&#39;t want it, then there&#39;s no role for me to play anymore.\n\nBesides, Mikejima’s already taken over his tutoring at this point.\nWe haven’t reviewed enough, but we’ve covered roughly all of the material that’ll be on the test. I don’t know what Mikejima intends to teach him, but with where Nagumo’s at right now, he should be able to avoid failing.\n\n\n\n—Hm? Tetora-kun’s study session hasn’t started yeT?\n\nSakasaki? For certain reasons, it’s already ended.\n\nDid you need something?\n\nNo, I didn’t really have any businesS.\nHoweveR, Sora heard about the session from Tetora-kuN.\nHe wanted to participatE, but unfortunately the timing didn&#39;t work out because of worK.\n\n...? So why are you here, Sakasaki?\n\nIt looks like Sora will be able to join the study session tomorroW. I just happened to have some free timE, so I thought I&#39;d check out what Hasumi-senpai&#39;s study session was likE.\nIn other words, I’m here out of curiositY.\n\nAh, don’t get the wrong ideA. Sora isn’t taking the makeup tesT.\nIt might be because Ibara Lecture hasn&#39;t been held recentlY, but he’s interested in Hasumi-senpai&#39;s study session, since it has similar activitieS.\n\nThe timing for Tetora-kun was unfortunate toO. If Ibara Lecture had been held, he could’ve reviewed last year&#39;s work and avoided failinG..\nIbara-kuN’s surprisingly good at that sort of thing, sO...\n\n… Come to think of it, Nagumo also belongs to Ibara Lecture, doesn&#39;t he?\nHow is he in that circle?\n\nHow is he? ...Your question’s a bit vague, isn&#39;t it?\n\nSorry. Classroom learning doesn’t seem to be Nagumo’s forte, correct? I was curious about the kind of tutoring Saegusa was giving that guy.\nI&#39;ve heard a little bit about it before, but... He doesn’t just teach supplemental classes, but teaches management too, is that right?\n\nThat&#39;s righT. It may surprise yoU, but they&#39;re actually taking the usual classroom lectureS.\nBut for more complicated topics like team management and asset management, they learn it in the form of business gameS.\n\nGames…?\n\nMhm. Sora also finds the activities enjoyablE. Tetora-kun seems to have fun racking his brains toO.\n\nI see, so it’s gamified learning? That would definitely be something that keeps up interest.\n\n(... What&#39;s the point in lingering on something like that? Nagumo&#39;s tutoring has already been passed on to Mikejima.)\n(My way of doing things will only cause Nagumo pain... In that case, it&#39;s probably best to just step aside.)\n(I’m aware of that, but…)\n\n……\n\nWhat is it, Hasumi-senpai?\n\n… Otogari, and you too Sakasaki. Could you give me a bit of your time?\n\nChapter 8\n\n    Location: AOUMI Aquarium\n\n\n\nIf you’ve got a grip on the questions beforehand, it&#39;s easy to get full marks on a test!\nFor a student who doesn’t like studying, that’s the cleanest way to get a good test score, iiisn’t it?\n\nWahaha! That&#39;s true, even I could get a perfect score if I did that~♪\n\nWhat are you talking about?! It’s not right to do somethin’ like stealing the question sheets!\nIf I got caught, I could get more than just a slap on the wrist!\n\nHahaha! It’s not gonna be an issue if you don&#39;t get caught, riiight?\nAnyways, don&#39;t worry! I’m kiiidding.\n\nR-Right. There’s no chance Mikejima-senpai’d do something like that, right?\n\nMhm! I want you to trust me on that!\n\nWhat I actually want to teach you is this here, see?\n\nWhat&#39;s that, a mechanical pencil?\n\nIndeed it is. It&#39;s an everyday mechanical pencil that you can buy aaanywhere. And if you take it apart like this...\nA tiny piece of paper comes out of it~♪ Just write the vocab you couldn&#39;t memorize here...\n\nIsn’t that a cheat sheet!? I’m not doing that either!\n\nHahaha. That was quick, Tetora-san.\nThis was obviously another joke, sooo don’t worry about it.\n\nYou shouldn’t make those sorts of jokes\n\nAll things said, Tetora-san suuure is serious.\n\nIt has nothing to do with being serious or anythin’ like that. It’s against the rules and it&#39;s playing dirty! That&#39;s not manly at all!\n\n… If that’s how you see things, then contrary to what you think, Keito-san’s tutoring methods miiight have been a good fit for you after all, Tetora-san.\n\nWhaddya mean?\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks! In other words, if there’s a change in tutors, there’s a change in teaching methods.\nThe previous two methods were extreme, but... there’s my teaching methods and Keito-san’s teaching methods. I wanted you to see how each of them were completely different.\n\n… Does that mean that you teach people how to improve their grades with underhanded tactics, Mikejima-senpai?\n\nHahaha! Weeell, I’ll just say it’s not the most straightforward approach, yeah?\n\nBut at any rate, I don&#39;t plan to teach you how to break the rules like earlier, so please rest easy.\nEven if you did do something like cheat, it wouldn’t accurately measure your academic ability, so there’d be no point in even taking the test.\nCheating’s an unproductive method that comes with too many risks. It&#39;s sheer stupidity to waste your precious school years on something like that.\n\nSo what kinda study tricks are you gonna teach me, Mikejima-senpai?\n\nMm! Well then, let&#39;s start the lesson right away!\nDo you have your history textbook on you? If you don&#39;t mind, could you hand it over?\n\nMy textbook? Sure, is this fine?\n\nLemme write a liiittle in the textbook... here and here. And theeen around here.\n\n… Aaalright, Tetora-san! If you focus on studying the parts I marked, I think you can avoid failing~♪\n\nThe parts you marked…  could they be…?\n\nAs you might’ve figured, the method I teach is to focus on questions that are most likely to appear on the test... &quot;playing the odds&quot;3, if you will.\nWhile Keito-san aims for a high grade by spreading his studies across all of the test material, Madara Lecture avoids failing by memorizing nothing but the main points of the material.\n\nAnd in reality, the questions that appear on tests are almost always the same. The most important concepts of that subject don&#39;t change so easily, after all.\nIn math, it&#39;s problem patterns that appear frequently, and in history, it&#39;s important events and notable figures.\nThe wider the test’s topics are, the stronger this tendency becomes. I double-checked the handout that Keito-san made, but I think your makeup test is gonna be the same way.\n\nBreak through with one point! If you&#39;re not good at studying, it&#39;s important to study in ways that are efficient. That means you have to pick and choose to achieve that, riiight?\n\nBut if I do this, I’m definitely gonna be lost on the parts I didn&#39;t study...\n\nMhm. That&#39;s the hard part about the &quot;playing the odds&quot; method.\nNo matter what, you&#39;ll always lose to the kids who read everything in the textbook and solve practice problems over and over again.\n\nBut like I said at the start, it’s a study method that can help you avoid failing a test — as long as you don’t lose the odds, that is.\n… If everyone could tackle their studies like Keito-san does, it wouldn’t be so hard. But there are always going to be kids who can’t concentrate forever, even when they try to study in earnest.\n\nThe study methods I teach are aimed for those kinds of kids.\nAll that to say, in order for studying to be enjoyable, it&#39;s important to find a study method that suits you.\nAnd that means, just because a study method you tried didn&#39;t work well for you, doesn’t mean you should fret over it.\n\n……\n\nIf you learn about aaall the different kinds of study methods and find one that suits you, your grades should improve dramatically.\nWhich of them you choose is up to you, Tetora-san.\n\n……\n\n… Thank you. I appreciate it, Mikejima-senpai.\nI just couldn&#39;t bring myself to enjoy studying...\nBut after hearing what you said, I think there could be a study method out there that I’d like.\n\nYeah! Thaaat&#39;s the spirit!\n\n… That’s why, in order to study properly, I wanna apologize to Hasumi-senpai before anything else.\n\nHahaha. That&#39;s a very Tetora-san-answer.\n\nBut before that. Let&#39;s enjoy this aquarium first.\nI&#39;ll give Tetora-san’s answer a gold star after that~♪\n\nOssu! Since we came all this way, let&#39;s learn more about fish before we go home~!\n\n… By the way, where’d Tsukinaga-senpai go?\n\nLeo-san moved on ahead quiiite a while ago.\nI’m sure that means he’s enjoying the aquarium, exploring all the different tanks in wonder.\n\nCome on, let&#39;s go after him...☆\n\nChapter 9\n\n    Location: Seisoukan Gates\n\n\n\n……\n\nO~i, Tetora. Why’re you frozen stiff like a statue? Weren’t you gonna apologize to Keito for skipping the lesson?\n\nThat&#39;s what I planned to do, but… now that we’ve come this far, I&#39;m freaking out all of a sudden.\nWhat am I gonna do if Hasumi-senpai’s really, really angry…?\n\nI think you’re worrying toooo much, Tetora-san. Keito-san’s mellowed out a bunch compared to when he was at the academy.\nBesides, if he’s gonna be mad at someone, I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be me for taking you away.\n\nYeah, ‘cause Mama was the one who kidnapped the person Keito was supposed to be teaching.\nOr rather, Mama made sure the situation would turn out that way.\nMama made it so that Keito sees it as a decision Mama made on his own, so that Tetora doesn’t take the blame.\n\nHahaha! And as a matter of fact, it was indeed my decision to snatch Tetora-san.\n\nSo you can just meet up with Keito-san without needing to worry about anything. If he gets angry at you, Mama will protect youuu ☆\n\n… No, I can&#39;t cause any more trouble for Mikejima-senpai and Tsukinaga-senpai!\n\nI&#39;ll apologize to Hasumi-senpai sincerely!\n\nJust when I think you&#39;ve become meek and pale, you become energetic in an instant… It never gets tiring watching you~♪\n\n\n    Location: Seisoukan Common Room\n\n\n\nOssu! Nagumo Tetora here, I’m back!\n\nHuH? Back so soon are yoU, Tetora-kun?\n\nYou weren’t with just Mikejima-senpai, but Tsukinaga-senpai too?\n\nAdonis and Natsume? What an unusual combination to see together.\nWhere’d Keito go? Did he sulk away and shut himself up in his room, maybe?\n\nActually, what’re you doing here, Senpais? I think Otogari-senpai’s holding some kinda book, but why…?\n\nWe’re recreating a landscape from 500 years ago at the moment.\n\nLandscape from 500 years ago…?\n\nOhh, it’s true! Is this paper mache? Why’re you making something like this?\n\nTruly, I have no cluE. I just came to look arounD, I didn’t think I&#39;d end up getting dragged into something like thiS.\n\nHm. It looks to be a diorama. This trench is liiike a river.\n\nA river…? Now that I’m getting a closer look, I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere before.\nYeah, if I’m not getting things wrong, this is from the Sengoku Period…\n\nNagumo! You’re back?!\n\n\n\nUhyaa!? H-Hasumi-senpai!? How long have you been there?\n\nI just returned now. So Mikejima and Tsukinaga were with you too?\n\nYep. We juuust got back, Keito-san.\n\nUwaa, Keito! What’re you holding!? A castle!?\n\nHold it, Tsukinaga. It still hasn’t dried yet, so don’t touch it!\n\nAnyway, I didn’t think Nagumo would be back so soon.\n\nUmm, Hasumi-senpai… erm…\nI’m really, really, really sorry for going off on my own and skipping out on our study session!\n\n… Lift your head, Nagumo. I&#39;m the one who should be apologizing…\nOtogari told me everything. It seems I was too enthusiastic in tutoring you.\n\nI didn&#39;t realize studying was becoming genuinely stressful for you, and I forced you to push yourself. I&#39;m truly sorry.\n\nNo! You’re not to blame, Hasumi-senpai! It’s me who lacked the guts for it, that’s all...\n\nIt&#39;s not a matter of guts. Everyone has their own way of studying that suits them.\nAnd in this case, the way I did it just didn&#39;t suit you.\n\nThat&#39;s the same thing Mikejima-senpai told me.\n\nIs that right? So Mikejima already told you… I&#39;ve caused you trouble, too.\n\nNah. You don’t need to worry about it, it’s fine. I can get you blaming me for stealing your precious student, but I don’t recall doing anything that deserves a thanks.\n\nThat aside, I&#39;m pretty curious about this diorama. Can you tell us what it’s all about, Keito-san?\n\nSure. This is a recreation of the terrain of a famous battle in the Sengoku period, made from paper-mache.\nI started making it after my phone call with Nagumo ended. With help from Otogari and Sakasaki, we were able to get it this far.\n\nTo be honest, I wanted to make it a bit more intricate, though.\n\nIt&#39;s important to worry about the detailS, but if that slows down the whole procesS, it’s just going to get in your waY.\n\nYeah. Thanks to Sakasaki&#39;s advice, I was able to make it to a certain extent.\nI&#39;m not really good at detail-oriented work, but I feel as though I can say I did a decent job.\n\nMhm. If you were able to make thiiis much in the time it took us to get back, I think it&#39;s plenty.\n\nSo? In the end, why’d you make this? It wasn&#39;t just ‘cause you wanted to put a craft together, right?\n\n… Like I said before, I heard Otogari out and realized that my teaching methods for Nagumo were wrong.\nThen I started giving it thought. What kind of instruction would make Nagumo enjoy studying?\nThen, by chance, Sakasaki happened upon us and told us about how you’re like at Ibara Lecture. And then, he told us about the study methods Ibara Lecture uses.\n\nI see. And so the result looks to be this diorama, huuuh?\n\nYes. I heard that Ibara Lecture utilizes gamified learning. I tried making this model off of that reference point.\n\nIf visualized information is used morE, it&#39;s easier to understand and it grabs people&#39;s attention. I’d think Tsukinaga-senpai would take to this method too, righT?\n\nHear, hear! This definitely seems a lot more interesting than reading a textbook that’s nothing but words!\n\n… Nagumo. I’ve already taught you roughly everything that’ll be on the test. If you just review the questions you got wrong, you should be able to avoid failing it.\n\nSo there’s nothing more to teach you at this point… Rather, I stressed you out so much that I don’t even think I have the right to teach you.\n\n\n\nBut, if there’s even a chance… that you haven’t gotten fed up with me, even after I cornered you into such intensive lessons…\nWould you try taking my course again, just one more time?\nYou don’t have to worry about this possibly being a review for everything you’ve learned. I just hope you can relax and have fun with it.\n\n… Why’re you doing all of this for me, Hasumi-senpai?\n\nIt’s partly an apology for making you work yourself too hard, but…\nMore than anything, I didn&#39;t want you to think that studying was only just a pain. That&#39;s all.\nWould you be interested…?\n\n… There’s no way I could turn down such a super interesting diorama.\nI wanna take Hasumi-senpai’s lesson one more time!\n\nMe, me! I wanna do it too! It’s fine, right, Keito!?\n\nHeh, I knew you&#39;d say that. One moment, I have the flip card4 for the answers.\n\nHahaha! That&#39;s a prop they use on variety shows. He might actually want some silly responses from us, guuuys~\n\nIt&#39;s not good to write the wrong answer on purpose, but... well, feel free to take it easy.\nOtogari, Sakasaki. How about you guys too? I still have some flip cards left, and I’d like to thank you for helping me out.\n\nOf course. I’m curious to see how the diorama we made is going to be used too.\n\nIt&#39;s not like I can refuse at this poinT… Oh well, this’ll do fine to kill some timE.\n\nHere, here’s yours, Mikejima.\n\nHuh? I can join in too?\n\nOn the contrary, why did you even think you wouldn’t be allowed to join in this circumstance?\n\nAs the instructor, I&#39;ll do my best to make this lesson enjoyable for you too.\n\n… Heh, I’m looking forward to iiit~\n\nHere, here, I saved a seat for Mama next to me!\n\nAlright! Well then, I’m counting on you, Keito-sensei…☆\n\nChapter 10\n\n    After a short while...\n\n\n\n(Aalrighty, I think I’m just in time for it.)\n(The dry ice should&#39;ve done the job, but I&#39;ll put it in the fridge just in case—)\n\n(... Hm? Seems like someone’s in the common room?)\n\nHm, this should be good.\n\nOh, so it is you, Keito-san. What are you doing in the common room?\nI&#39;m pretty sure Tetora-san’s makeup test was today. So you don’t need to prepare a study session anymore, right?\n\nMikejima? Like you said, I no longer need to hold study sessions for Nagumo.\nNow, I’m making props to use in Keito Lecture.\nI felt like the way I tutored Nagumo was a success. I wanted to try it out in Keito Lecture, so I’ve made these.\n\nI see. So next is a game that uses cards, huuuh?\n\nYes. It&#39;s a card game where everyone answers whether an action is the right manners or not at the same time.\nIt takes time to make small pieces of craft, but once you start, it&#39;s surprisingly fun.\nI drew easy-to-understand illustrations on the cards, and paid careful attention to the legibility on the image.\n\nThaaat’s Keito-san for you. It looks good enough to be sold as is ♪\n\nDid you make this one too?\n\nYes. That’s already completed. I don’t mind if you look at it however you like.\nLet me know if there&#39;s anything that catches your eye. I&#39;ll make some revisions before the day of Keito Lecture activities.\n\nHaha, you&#39;re fuuull of motivation, huh? Seems like you truly do enjoy tutoring, Keito-san.\n\n… That&#39;s true. I learn a lot through teaching others– not only for the students but also for myself.\nI might like tutoring others in that sense as well.\n\nBut it seems like when I tutor, I get severely out of hand without considering the students, so I still have a long way to go...\n\nThere’s no need to worry! If you’re capable of considering that now, you&#39;ll be fine, Keito-san!\n\n… Mikejima. I say this again; I know that I caused you trouble with Nagumo the other day.\nIf you hadn&#39;t taken him out, I probably would’ve subjected him to another horrible lesson that day.\nIt&#39;s thanks to you that I was able to change my perspective. Let me thank you again.\n\nHmmm? What are you talking about?\nI just wanted to hang out with Tetora-san that day, there&#39;s nooo deeper meaning to it.\n\nThere’s no need to dodge the subject.\nNagumo told me. You taught him how to “play the odds&quot;\n\nAnd in actuality, that’s a useful study method that suits Nagumo. I would also try to guess what ​​the usual tests’ question topics would be, too.\n\nThat&#39;s a surprise. I thought Keito-san was the type to study thoroughly.\n\nOf course, reading the textbook and solving the problem sets is a given. And on top of that, I would review what was most likely to be on the test– the most important parts within the test’s subject matter.\nBy doing that, you can deepen your understanding.\n\n… However, not everyone can study in the same way. Instead of forcing what works best for you on others, you need to consider the study method that suits them best.\nThat&#39;s what I learned from this situation.\n\nHmm. I really hadn&#39;t thought about it thaaat far...\n\nBuuut either way, if it could be helpful to you, Mama’s happy☆\n\n… By the way, what’s that you have there?\n\nHmm? This is...\n\nHasumi-senpai– Hasumi-senpai are you here~!?\n\nYou’re making a racket, Nagumo Tetora.\n\nAh, there you are! And Mikejima-senpai too!\n\nYes, welcome back! You had an interview job straight after school today, didn’t you?\n\nOssu! I got that done too! ‘Cuz there was something I wanted to tell you guys right away!\n\n\n\n… Ta~daaa! The results of today&#39;s quiz!\n\nWhoa, you got higher than a 90%! That’s amaaazing, Tetora-san!\n\nHmmm. It seems like you got the right answer on everything I taught you. Great job, Nagumo.\n\nAs long as you put your heart and soul into it, you’ll end up on top! And it’s the result of studying hard with Keito-san these past few days too~♪\n\nHeheh! It really does feel good to get a good score! All the hard work was worth it!\nThank you both so, so, so much...!\n\nHahaha, I’m happy Tetora-san got a good grade toooo! Heeere we go, time to give you uppies ♪\n\nUwaa, hold on Mikejima-senpai! Please don’t toss me up so suddenly!\n\nI know you’re happy, but set him down, Mikejima.\n\nHmmm... Can’t be helped. Now then, to celebrate Tetora-san’s hard work, here’s a present from me.\n\n…? Did you get this cake5 from the place in front of the train station?\n\nYep! I bought it to congratulate you on your hard work on the test. It’s aaall yours to eat~♪\n\nReally?! I’m so grateful~!\n… But since we&#39;re all here anyways, I’d love it if you two could eat it with me too.\n‘Cuz it’s thanks to my seniors I was able to get such a good grade!\n\n… Is that really okay? Mikejima is the one who bought that for you…\n\nI can’t eat this by myself. Besides, this sorta thing tastes better if you share it with others!\n\nI don&#39;t mind. Tetora-san’s sooo kind~♪\nWell then, I&#39;ll go get the plates and forks!\n\nAh, I&#39;ll go with you, Mikejima-senpai!\n\n(I&#39;m glad to see your efforts pay off, Nagumo.)\n\nHasumi-senpai. Do you know who this belongs to?\n\nHm? Is that a magazine?\n\nI think so. It was on the kitchen table, so I brought it over just in case...\n\nSomeone must’ve left it behind. Maaaybe they’ll notice and come and get it.\n\nYeah, you&#39;re right. I&#39;ll put it back where it was, then.\n\n… Wait a second, a paper slipped out from the magazine.\n\nThis looks like… some kind of printout?\n\nYeah, it does. … Uwaa! That score’s as low as mine was. Who in the world does this belong to—?\n\n— Shiratori Aira…?\n\n… H-Hasumi-senpai? Where are you going?\n\nSorry, Nagumo. The two of you, eat the cake for me.\nLooks like I’ve found someone new to tutor.\n\nShiratori-kun…\n\nHahaha!

Inflections in this translation are based off of the live reading of the chapter from the 4piece final ceremony livestream.\n\n\n    This story is fully voiced. However, the script from the live reading is slightly altered from the script in the story below. Click the video above to listen while reading.\n\n\n\nFinal Ceremony 3\n\n  \n    Ibuki's entrance into AKATSUKI has insensitive parallels to the history between Japan and the Ryukyu Islands, specifically the annexation of Ryukyu into Okinawa from 1872-1879 onward. Click for more information\n  \n  \n  AKATSUKI is a unit embodied by 和 (wa, lit. harmony, but also a self-designator for Japan). The word 和風 (wafu, Japanese style) comes from 和. During the Meiji Restoration, 和 was central to Japan’s efforts to unify and assimilate new territories under a shared cultural identity. On top of his membership, Ibuki's active pursuit of 本当の和風 (true Japanese-style) being the reason he pursues AKATSUKI is inappropriate, bearing this in mind.\n  \n     Additionally, the Ryukyu Disposition was driven by military interests, particularly securing Japan's southern borders from other nations. In Okinawan schools, national pride was linked to serving Japan’s military goals. This had devastating consequences, particularly during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. This in mind, having Ibuki join the self-proclaimed \"war unit\" is also inappropriate. \n  Read the full-length analysis here: Unpacking Shinsei (新生) AKATSUKI; An Extended Translation Note and Analysis.\n\n\n    After the end of the 4piece Final Ceremony\n\n\n\n(Yaaaawn…)\n\nAhh~ I haven’t been able to reel in anything big for a while now~.....\n\nAnd the times I do catch something, it&#39;s just some lil’ small fry like a sardine. Hard times~\n\nThat bein’ said, who woulda thought that behind the audition venue was such a vast ocean?\nIt was hidden by that ginormous structure, what a waste, y’know~ If they were gonna set up a venue, they should have made it so that there’d be a full view of the ocean.\n\nWhy don’t those from the mainland cherish the sea~? The ocean is the mother of all life~\n\nI think it&#39;s wild that Nassan built such a ginormous building just for the sake of the audition, though.\nWell, the people of this country are show-offs, so maybe it&#39;s necessary to set the stage like that~\n\n(Yaaawn…) … Still, not catching any fish like this is boooring~....\nBesides, if things keep up like this I’ll end up going hungry. That’s no joke~\n\nThe venue has quieted down a lot, hasn&#39;t it? I wonder if the final ceremony has ended.\n\nI really only joined the audition ‘cuz Nassan asked me to — but it was actually pretty fun for me~♪\n\nI don’t see how I wasn’t selected for the Nice Dream Unit, though.\nThat Nassan, telling me &quot;I just wanted to guide your talent to this country and help it grow,&quot; to woo me over, and yet…\nYou got my hopes up, and now you’re not gonna choose me, huh?\nSo cruel of him~ No one likes a man who won’t feed the fish he’s caught, y’know~\nOr maybe Nassan’s eyes were going bad when he spotted me.\n\nWell, it doesn’t matter~\nAs far as I’m concerned, there were other encounters that were more meaningful to me than being selected for the Nice Dream Unit~\n\nHm~mm… Liiike, you know?\nI’d say I had a lotta fun with Hasumi-san during the audition~? We even said &quot;see ya later&quot; to each other at the end.\n\nBut, when is “later” gonna be? Another thing I can’t grasp, huh~\nAnyhow, conflict&#39;s all I’ve known, after all~... I wanna keep from sparking any conflict with Hasumi-san and the guys in AKATSUKI the best I can.\n\nNyahaha, while I was thinking about aaall that, I missed the perfect time to bring my reel in~ My loss ☆\n\nWell, whatever. Nankuru nai sa~1\nNow then, maybe I’ll catch a big one next…?\n\n\n……\n\nMm~mm. He’s not here either…\nI looked around all the notable places in and around the venue, but he’s nowhere to be found. Figures, he must have already gone home. That Taki…\nHonestly… Leaving in the middle of the final ceremony…\n\nThe recent recruits are too free and loose, with that guy protesting the results and all… How incorrigible…!\n\nI’ve already gone out of my way to talk to Kiryu and Kanzaki too. I should have been quick to speak with Taki, but I didn’t expect him to be this hard to find.\nI should’ve exchanged contact information as soon as the audition concluded.\nOn the other hand, if I were to get his details through the agency or Anzu at a later date, It’d seem like I’m coercing him into it which would feel a little dicey, so—\n\n\n    A big gust of wind blows through.\n\n\n… Gh!?\n\nThat huge gust of wind startled me… The winds are really strong here, huh?\n\nHm? There’s a little path right here. I never noticed it during the audition.\nWhere does it lead to…?\n\n\nOh…? So this little path leads out to the ocean, huh… The gust of wind must have come from the sea.\n\n… Hm? Somebody’s humming a song…?\n\n♪~♪~♪~\n\nWh–Taki!? What are you doing here?\n\nNyahaha~ This is the big catch I’ve been hoping to come my way...♪\n\nThe big catch? What are you talking about?\nTaki, I’ve been looking for you for a while now. There’s something I need to talk to you about. Lend me a second of your time.\n\nOh~ That right~? I had something I wanted to say to you too~\n……\nI think there are some moments in this world that we just can’t let get away. Those so-called “chances” and “golden opportunities”, so to speak—\nAnd, I think that those who can grasp onto them will be able to find success.\n\nYeah, I get it. I think the same.\n\nIs that right? What a coincidence.\n\nWhat a coincidence indeed~\n\nI believe that golden opportunity for me must be… right now.\n— Taki. Why don’t you perform a live together with us AKATSUKI? 2\n\nNyaha-haaa~ I was gonna ask you the exact same thing~\nFrom me too…\n\n\nHasumi-san, let’s do a live together, me and AKATSUKI. 3\n\nYes— that would be great. I look forward to working with you…!\n\n— For the sake of finding out what this true “Japanese-style” is…4\n\nHm? What did you say just now? I couldn’t hear you very well over the seabreeze.\n\nNah. Don’t worry about it~\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ The short version of the full Okinawan saying まくとぅそーけーなんくるないさ (makutou so-ke- nankuru nai sa) “If you’ve done everything as honest as you can, it’ll all work itself somehow”.

Here, Umehara (Keito's VA) extends his hand out, offering it.↑ Kobayashi (Ibuki's VA) then extends his hand out.↑ 和 (wa) refers to a foundational cultural value in Japan that emphasizes social harmony through maintaining peaceful relationships within a group. 和 encourages compromise, consensus, and the avoidance of open conflict. Generally, it can refer to &quot;Japanese-ness&quot;, and is used in words like 和風 (wafu, Japanese style)."},{"title":"Hanafuda","url":"/translation//hanafuda/","content":"\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                Hanafuda\n                花札\n                \n                    Start Reading\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    While playing hanafuda with Souma, the transfer student realizes the deck Kuro entrusted her with is missing a card.

Vice President. 1\nDo you have business with Class-2A?\n\nDon’t call me that, it makes me sound like I’m in the yakuza. I’m aware that you hate me, but you’ll have an easier life if you concealed your malice a little more.\n\nYes, yeS, I don&#39;t want a lecture…\nBut it&#39;s really unusual for you to come to our classroom, isn’t iT? Since you&#39;re such a distinguished vice president, why don&#39;t you just invite the underclassmen to your citadeL?\n\nI have an errand for a guy who doesn&#39;t have the means for me to call him, so I have to walk there myself, don’t I?\n\nAhhH… So you’re here for Sohma-kuN?2 That boy doesn’t carry a phone with him– a pretty rare habit these dayS.\nThat’s why there’s no choicE but to use old-fashioned means of communicatioN.\n\nIt helps that you’re quick to the point. Is Kanzaki here?\n\nYeP. LooK, he’s playing in the corner of the classrooM.\n\nNow, now, it’s about time for our match…☆\n\nHmm. He&#39;s unusually riled up, though it&#39;s fitting for a high school boy.\nI&#39;m glad he’s having fun... He&#39;s an odd guy, so I was worried he&#39;d stick out like a sore thumb in class.\n\nAhaha. It&#39;s not unusual to see &quot;odd guys&quot; at Yumenosaki Academy nowadayS, since it&#39;s become a breathable environment, you knoW.\nEspecially for Sohma-kuN. He’s mellowed out since he became a second-yeaR.\nWell, whateveR. I’d hate to see people think I’m buddy-buddy with the vice president because we talked for so lonG, so I&#39;M going to go noW.\n\nRight, right, go off now. I&#39;m sorry for interrupting you as you were leaving the classroom, Sakasaki.\n\nDon’t worrY, it was just bad timinG. No, it was bad lucK... I wonder if I&#39;ve contracted Senpai&#39;s misfortunE?\n\n( ... There he goes. Peculiar as always, just what you&#39;d expect from a former member of the Five Eccentrics.)\n(But before, every time we met, he’d harass me in some way, like pelting me with beans3...)\n(Compared to that, I feel that we&#39;ve been able to interact much more amicably.)\n\n(I don’t think it means he’s forgiven us… But maybe it shows that Sakasaki is changing too.)\n(I figured he was the type of person who had little room to grow since he had such a high level of perfection to begin with, but look at him now.)\n\n(Heheh. The good changes and remarkable improvement of the underclassmen always manages to surprise me.)\n\n\nAlright! This Kanzaki Souma is the parent! I’ve finally got parental rights…☆4\n\n… Hm?\n\nHmhmm, my hand is quite excellent, too. This match shall be mine to take, Anzu-dono~♪\n\n... Kanzaki. What is this, what are you and Anzu talking about? I may have to lecture you for an hour or so depending on the situation.\n\nOh, Hasumi-dono! What a surprise; what brings you all the way to my classroom?\nIn the event of an emergency, I’d have gone anywhere if you had simply called for me!\n\nEven for me, I think it&#39;s inefficient to come find you every time I need you for something, but...\nI don&#39;t have any other choice. No matter how many times I tell you to, you don&#39;t carry your smartphone on you.\nSmartphones these days are easy to operate, even for people who aren’t accustomed to modern appliances. Kiryu and I will show you how to use it thoroughly if you need us to.\n\nAhaha. A sermon right out the gate; that is truly just like you to do, Hasumi-dono.\nLet us leave that aside for now; what really brought you here?\n\nMm. I’ve received a small job to do over the weekend… so I want you to come to the dojo after school today. I’d like to discuss the matter with the three of us together– Kiryu included.\nBut today was supposed to be a day off from AKATSUKI activities, so if you have other things to do, you can prioritize those.\n\nA-ha. Right, I understand. I’m humbled by your concern, but I have no matter nor training to conduct today, so I can attend the meeting.\n\nIs that right? That&#39;s good to hear. It’d be tiring to have to repeat the same explanation over and over again, so it’ll be easier if I do it all at once.\nWell if that’s the case, I&#39;d like you to come to the dojo after school. I don’t mind if you take your time.\n\nUnderstood. Ahh, I apologize profusely for making you come all the way here just for that.\nHowever, considering how Hasumi-dono operates, I believe you could’ve chosen to call me by broadcast or the like.\n\nWouldn’t you hate that and say something like, “It’s disgraceful of me…”? Being called over the intercom doesn’t give a good impression to everyone around you, after all.\nIt’s easier to walk to the second-year classroom than to ask a member of the Broadcasting Committee to call for you anyways, so don&#39;t worry about it too much, Kanzaki.\n\nI feel like I gained something by seeing how you usually behave in the classroom. I’m glad to see you’re enjoying yourself much more than I&#39;d expected.\n\nChapter 2\n\nI see. I was shocked to hear such a suspicious remark from you earlier, but now I get it... You were playing with hanafuda cards.\nThat&#39;s why you were talking about parental rights, right? Are you playing Koi-Koi by any chance?5 \n\nHaving fun and making merry with classmates in the classroom is typical of high schoolers. But I feel like hanafuda card games as a choice of game are too complicated.\n\nHahaha, how embarrassing of me. Personally, I am more familiar with this game than games like “Toranpu”6, but…\nIt seems like everyone my age doesn’t know how to play, which makes me feel a little lonely.\n\nAdonisu-dono showed interest, so I’ve taught him all sorts of things, but he still hasn’t memorized the “ruuru”.\n\n......\n\nHm, Otogari? Come to think of it, you’re in the same class as Kanzaki, and you’re close friends, aren’t you?\n\nAhh, Hasumi-senpai… Lend me your help. I’d like to play a hanafuda card game with Kanzaki and Anzu too, but the terminology is too complicated.\n\nThat’s not surprising. I only understand the simplest and most familiar card game, Koi-Koi. But I haven&#39;t played it in a while, so I only vaguely remember the hand combinations.\n\nAhh, yes… No matter how many times the combinations are explained to me, I can&#39;t connect them to the words that I do know, so I look up the meaning of each word in a dictionary and write them down in my notebook.\nUmm… This one with this one would be sakura ni maku7... Which is “Cherry Blossom” and “Curtain Call”…?\n\nYou’re starting to sound like Suou, Otogari.8\n\nUu… Oogami likes card games in general, so we usually play together… so I’m sure that if I could just remember the rules, I could play with you guys too.\n\nHeheh. Adonisu-dono, you might not be confident with the language yet, but you’re quite clever, aren’t you?\nInstead of getting trapped by the actual meaning of the terminology, I think it&#39;s better to memorize words through intuition by looking at them.\nAll hanafuda cards have pictures on them, so it&#39;s better to memorize them by the pictures than by the meanings of the words.\nGenerally, the more extravagant the picture, the stronger the card… or rather, the higher the score.\nHere, this is a picture with the moon on top of a mountain, correct?\nWhen you combine it with the sake card, you get the “moon-viewing with a drink” hand.9\nIt&#39;s like having a glass of sake while looking at the moon: getting tipsy and feeling good.\n\nThis one is sake? So this red part wasn’t… erm, a UFO of some sort?\n\nHmm. It certainly does look like an unidentified flying object, but it&#39;s actually sake.\n\nSo, the object behind this strangely pessimistic-looking bird... Is it also sake? 10\n\nHeheh. Since you know such an advanced term for the meaning of “pessimistic”, 11 you’ll surely be able to pick up the terms used in hanafuda quickly.\nIt just so happens that this is the moon. A crescent moon, to be exact.\n\nSo this is also a moon…? Alright, when you combine this with the sake card, do you still get “moon-viewing with a drink”?\n\nNo. Unfortunately, it doesn’t become a legible hand unless the sake card is matched with this full moon card.\n\nIt’s so hard… Hanafuda’s so hard…\n\nDon’t say that, I’d like you to try your best to learn it.\nThere are games like “Hachi-Hachi”12 that are meant to be played with three people, so if Adonisu-dono grows to understand hanafuda, it will be more fun.\n\nHahaha. Looks like you&#39;re having a hard time, Kanzaki.\n\nNo, no, talking with Adonisu-dono is beneficial for me as well.\nI think that trying to explain difficult things in an understandable way also fits with AKATSUKI’s principles.\nLike traditional performing arts… When it comes to things like Noh and Kabuki, many people don&#39;t understand the meaning of the words, and thus can’t understand the fun behind it.\nWe AKATSUKI will be the ones who translate and provide that “fun” in a modern way.\nThat is another one of AKATSUKI’s principles that I resonate with.\nEven when I perform on stage for an event related to my household, I find it a shame that small children look at me in confusion, due to it being incomprehensible to them.\n\nYes, that sounds about right. At my temple, we try to explain the meaning of sutras in an understandable, modern way too.\n\nHeheh, being born and raised in such a house is truly why Hasumi-dono is the linchpin of AKATSUKI’s founding principles.\n\n… Oh, it isn’t really the time to casually chat, is it?\nAt this rate, we may not have time to cook, Anzu-dono.\nSo far, I’ve been in the lead this round, so is it alright if I&#39;m in charge of cooking today?\n\n? What do you mean by that?\n\nRight. Anzu-dono and I often eat together at the cafeteria, choosing the “koosu” where we make the meal ourselves.\nWe do so especially when “Torikkusutaa” is away for work and such.\n\nAh, now that I think about it, there isn’t a noisy pack of guys hanging around. I guess they&#39;re busy taking their preparation seriously for SS.\n\nMhm. This time they seem to be doing a magazine interview that wasn’t organized by Anzu-dono, so she is left to “house-sit” at school, so to speak.\nIt seems like she’d like to accompany all of “Torikkusutaa”&#39;s activities if she could, though.\n\nDon’t. If you’re always hanging out with those guys, you won&#39;t be able to attend class properly.\nSince they’re specifically out for a job, Trickstar is still considered as attending school, but for you, Anzu, it’d be considered as cutting classes under the rules.\nIt&#39;s not a good idea to end up in a situation like that vampire where you have to repeat a grade because you didn’t attend enough days.\n\n… Hm, the producer course will properly start next school year, so the rules regarding attendance will need to be adjusted a bit.\n\nChapter 3\n\nAt any rate, if I recall correctly… As the name suggests, the DIY course at the cafeteria gives you the experience of making your own food.\nAnd since the ingredients are available in advance, it’s cheaper than ready-made meals.\n\nMhm. It helps with learning how to cook as well, so I can kill two birds with one stone.\nNormally, Anzu-dono and I cook separately or cook together, but…\nLately, she seems to be busy taking care of “Torikkustaa”.\n\nSo the meals she cooks have been visibly meager… or to be more specific, it looked as though she was cutting corners with the recipe, and I could not stand to watch her do that to herself...\nThat is when I offered to cook for Anzu-dono every day if she wanted.\nBut she firmly declined, saying she’d feel guilty about it...\nAnzu-dono ended up insisting that it was her duty to take care of us “aidoru” and that she would even make mine every day.\nBy the end of a heated discussion… We decided that there would be a competition and the winner would be the one to cook.\n\nIs that right… The fact it’s not “the loser” who cooks is just like you guys.\nI feel like there were other options, like ordering regular food instead of making it yourself, but…\n\nWell, if you guys are satisfied with that then I have no right to speak on it. Anyways… That’s why you two were playing hanafuda?\n\nMhm. Well, I’ve enjoyed hanafuda since I was a child so I have the advantage.\nIt would be more fair if we compete in Anzu-dono’s area of ​​expertise tomorrow, huh.\n\n… Hm? You’re disappointed that you lost and want to keep playing until you win?\n\nYou’re surprisingly competitive, Anzu-dono. Or perhaps I should say, you’re manly every now and then~♪\n\nWhen it comes to girls, I don’t think you should be making comments about how “manly” they are...\n\nWell, the truth is, she has become much more resolute compared to when she first entered the school.\n\nHm? Anzu-dono said, “Shishou praised me!” with delight… For some reason Anzu-dono’s started calling Hasumi-dono Shishou since the other day, mm? 13\n\nDon&#39;t look too deeply into it, Kanzaki.\n\nU-... Understood… I am not sure why, but your eyes are scary, Hasumi-dono.\n\nPutting that aside, I’m sorry for talking for so long, you all. It&#39;s a bad habit of mine…\nI suppose you&#39;re going from here to the cafeteria to cook, so you’d better get a move on before lunch break is over.\n\nHmm, that&#39;s true too.\n\nWell then, Hasumi-dono, please excuse us for now. Let us meet again at the AKATSUKI meeting after school~♪\n\nMhm. See you after school.\n\n\n...\n\n… Hm? You aren’t going with them, Otogari?\n\nI already ate.\nI bumped into Tenma a short while ago. He said he bought too much bread and gave me some... I tend to eat quickly when I can.\n\nWhat are you, a wild animal?\n\n… Although, compared to when we first met, you’ve become much more human-like. Or rather, your demeanor has become softer.\nNo, I suppose it’s that you’ve become more like an idol.\n\nThank you. You&#39;re praising me, aren’t you, Hasumi-senpai?\n\nThat aside, I&#39;ve been reading the hanafuda instruction manual for a while now, but there&#39;s something strange about it.\nKanzaki and Anzu didn&#39;t seem to notice, but I feel like there&#39;s one card missing.\nWhile I was watching them play, I counted their cards, but…\nIt seemed like the number of cards Kanzaki and Anzu were playing with didn’t match the number in the instruction manual.\n\nHmm, is that so?\nThey’ve already put the hanafuda cards back, so we can&#39;t check, but… You said there&#39;s one hanafuda card missing?\n\nHm~mm… I feel like I remember hearing something about a card like that somewhere...?\n\n\n    Location: Garden Terrace\n\n\nCome now, dig in to your heart’s content~♪\nI was able to display my skills to the fullest today as well!\n\nIt might be too much for two people to eat, but…\nTo be honest, I thought I would treat Adonisu-dono to a meal as well, so I had prepared extra ingredients.\nFresh fish is likely to spoil even if you choose to take it home, so I ended up cooking all of it right now.\n\nI make a bento for Adonisu-dono now and then. But these days, I’ve been making food in the cafeteria myself more than before.\nStill, it would feel strange for me to eat fresh cooking while Adonisu-dono eats a bento, so...\nI thought it would be more efficient if I prepared meals for Adonisu-dono all at once.\n\nBut today, Adonisu-dono received some “bu-read” from his junior...\nApparently he was already full, so I did not need to treat him to a meal.\nAdonisu-dono eats a lot, so he could probably make quick work of another meal, but… I don’t really intend to force him to eat.\n\nHm? What is it, Anzu-dono? &quot;You&#39;re really close friends, aren&#39;t you?&quot;\n\nIndeed. Adonisu-dono is my irreplaceable best friend. Besides, seeing him enjoy the food makes it well worth the effort to cook.\nStarting tomorrow, let’s reach out ahead of time and have lunch with Adonisu-dono.\nHe’s great at cooking as well, so it’d be nice to have him make us something as well.\n\nWe decided to play hanafuda to decide who would be in charge of cooking so...\nUntil then, we need Adonisu-dono to memorize the “ruuru” of hanafuda.\n\nHeheh. Playing, cooking, and sitting around the table with friends from the same &quot;kurasu&quot;...\nIf I was asked if this is truly something typical of a high school student, I wouldn’t be sure how to respond, but I personally find it very refreshing and comfortable.\n\nAhh, this is truly our springtime of youth.\n\nChapter 4\nContent Warning: Mentions of self-harm\n\n\nKanzaki-dono~! Anzu-dono~!\nOh, Sengoku. I’ve been seeing you around often, are you catching frog food again?14\n\nAh, no no. Lately, Shinkai-dono has been giving me some, so! I don’t have to swing around the flypaper on my own anymore~♪\n\nI see. That’s wonderful news. Buchou-dono is truly a kind, honorable man as ever, isn’t he?\n\nYeah! His eccentric behavior frightened me a little at the start, but now I’ve come to really rely on him!\n\nMore importantly. Kanzaki-dono, I overheard your conversation but… if you made too much to eat, could I have some?\n\nI’m actually a little short on money this month…\nThere was a ninja exhibition going on at a museum that was pretty far away, and I kept going all the time while ignoring the costs. I ended up pretty much emptying my wallet.\n\nHahaha. You truly do love ninjas, hm?\nYes, yes, come here... If anything, you’re a godsend, I’d appreciate it if you’d eat it for me. It&#39;s good to eat plenty and grow up properly.\nYou’re quite small after all, Sengoku. You should get proper nutrition and grow taller.\n\nAhaha, I’ve partially given up on my height, but…\nRYUSEITAI involves a lot of vigorous action, so it’ll be tough on me if I don’t build up some stamina.\n\nThank you, I’d be happy to join you. I’ll eat lots to build muscle.\n\nMhm. I hope it suits your taste. Anzu-dono has been looking weary these days, so I decided to make her a nutritious, supple fish dish.\nFish is good for your health. They say that solely eating red meat makes it easy for you to develop shortness of breath.\n\nYaaay! Thanks for the meal! I’m the kind of ninja that isn’t picky, so I’ll enjoy anything!\n\nYes, eat, eat.\n\n\n… Oh? Is something wrong, Anzu-dono? Why the long face?\nWas it something about the ingredients you didn’t like? I was under the impression you’d eat pretty much anything, though…\n\nHm? You felt something was off, counted the hanafuda cards, and found that one was missing…?\n\nLet me see which one. One… two… three… Ah, indeed, there’s only one card missing.\nThe one-point willow card is the one missing, perhaps. Since it’s a low-scoring, junk card, I didn’t notice it was missing while we were playing.\n\nA junk card…? It’s not like you to say something so harsh, Kanzaki-dono.\n\nNo, I say that because that’s how it’s officially called…\n\nHowever, regardless of its moniker, no card is unimportant enough to be excluded from a hanafuda deck. We can’t really play with this set.\n\nHmm? What’s the matter, Anzu-dono. Y–... You look like you’re about to cry for some reason?\n\nHm… This hanafuda set was entrusted to you by Kiryu-dono while you were working on organizing Quarrel Festival?15\nI had thought it was odd that you had something so unusual for a delicate high school girl, Anzu-dono. I see, so it was a borrowed item.\n\n\nThinking back on it, Quarrel Festival’s stage did have decorations that harkened back to hanafuda, like boars and deer and butterflies…16\nThe music composition and staging resembled a match of hanafuda too.\n\nMm. Speaking of which, Hasumi-dono tore into the Quarrel Festival preparations extensively, so it underwent intense reworks.\nSometime then, you borrowed some of the outfits and accessories from AKATSUKI to serve as reference…? And eventually, you forgot to return the hanafuda cards?\nToday, you found them in your bag, and it ended up being used for our duel…?\n\nMm, I’d thought it was incredibly refined of you to have such a hobby, Anzu-dono, but…\nSo that was the reason? I see…\n\nNow I understand why Anzu-dono looks pale. The missing card is from a borrowed deck.\nIf you lost it, it’d be a gravely serious offense... that’s what you were thinking.\n\nBut, Kiryu-dono was the one to lend it to you. I don’t think that honorable man would be the type to get angry with you for it.\n\nFor example, after a rigorous lesson, I nearly slashed him with my sword in my fatigue…\nBut he let me off with a pinch on the cheek, even though I was more than willing to commit seppuku17 should the occasion call for it.\n\nYou committing seppuku would just put him in a bad spot, so he probably had no choice but to laugh it off…?\n\n… Uwawa, Anzu-dono? Why did you suddenly stand up?\n\nEh? “Maybe I dropped the hanafuda card somewhere on my way to school, so I’ll search for it on my way home”...?\n\nMm. If that brings you peace of mind, I can’t particularly stop you, Anzu-dono… But before anything else, please eat. It’s said that there’s a proper order for everything.\nWe’ll eat, and then we’ll go search for it until the very last moment lunch break ends.\nIf we still can&#39;t find it then, we can try another time like after school, or speak to Kiryu-dono about the situation and apologize.\nIf you don&#39;t follow the proper steps and just act off of the heat of the moment, it won’t end well. That too is another important thing I learned from my seniors in AKATSUKI.\n\nThat&#39;s right, Anzu-dono. Although I understand the feeling of wanting to relieve your anxiety as quickly as you can... Searching for things is my bread and butter, so I&#39;ll help you look for it.\nIf you&#39;re searching for something, it&#39;s better to have assistance, right? In return for the meal, I’ll give it my all to help you.\nAh, if you dropped it on school grounds, someone might have picked it up and brought it to the lost-and-found box in the student council room. I&#39;ll go and check later.\n\nHeheh. Isara-dono asks me to hunt down the owners of lost items often, so I’m no stranger to this sort of thing.\n\nYou&#39;re so reliable, Sengoku. How admirable… Good, good (Pats), there’s plenty to eat.\n\nWow~ It kind of feels like I’m a small animal being hand fed~!\n\nHehe. Anzu-dono, you too, please eat your fill before anything else.\nYou can’t fight if you’re hungry18, and hurrying can only lead to mistakes, you know.\n\nChapter 5\n\n~...♪\n… There we go. Maybe somethin’ like that?\n\n(Mn…~ I can’t pin down why, but somethin’s off about it. It shouldn’t be too flashy like an idol outfit is.)\n(Thanks to bein’ in AKATSUKI, I’m gettin’ familiar with good ol’ traditional styles ‘n designs, but…)\n(It feels like I’m losing touch with the latest trends or somethin’.)\n(I seriously gotta get my antenna up a lil’ more to keep up with what’s new in fashion.)\n\n(But, I guess I’m better at givin’ off a more manly vibe in the end…)\n(I could get in the know faster if I just ask Lil’ Miss Anzu to tell me her thoughts on girly stuff, but she seems pretty damn busy lately.)\n(And my lil’ sister too… Maybe it’s my influence ‘cuz we’re siblings or somethin’, but she tends to like manly stuff, so...)\n\n(Man, I think I’ve got no choice but to ask Itsuki then, huh. —That guy’s the type to go against what’s popular too, but…)\n(He’s always liked girly things since forever, so yeah.)\n\n\nI’m coming in! Is Kanzaki here yet?!\n\nNn-oh? What’s got ya wound up, Hasumi-no-danna19... It isn’t like ya to be that way. Also, don’t just barge in, I got needles ‘n shit spread out.\nIf you step on a needle, it’ll be a big problem, be careful.\n\nS-... Sorry... Are you making outfits again, Kiryu? You really like making things, huh.\n\nWell, it’s partially just a hobby.\nLike, y’know how next year, there’s gonna be all sorts of changes kickin’ up, especially with the producer course?\nNew courses are gettin’ set up, and it seems like they’re gonna need new girls’ uniforms.\nLooks like there’s gonna be a competition, so I wanted to try throwin’ my hat in the ring.\nIt’s the real deal— pros outside the school can take part too, so I dunno if my design’s gonna be good enough. Still, I thought I’d give it my all anyways.\n\nAhh, I’ve heard talk about that. The reason we’re assembling today is to take part in a small-scaled job somewhere along those lines too.\n\nAlong those lines?\n\nYes. It&#39;s about time for exam season, so we’ll need to show up to events like orientation sessions and perform exhibition shows and the like.\nWe’ll be doing a light performance in front of the new students.\n\nHmm, so that&#39;s the kinda thing that goes on these days, huh? We didn&#39;t have orientation sessions back in our day… Seems better times have come upon us.\n\nSometimes, I just can’t tell how old you are. You sound like an old man, Kiryu.\n\nYou shouldn’t be the one sayin’ that to me, y’know. You’re the guy who gives “sittin’ by the window with a cup of tea”.\n\nHmph. At any rate, it’s because other schools have been rising in prominence recently.\nThe management of Yumenosaki Academy is desperate to attract new students. It seems they’re trying everything they can to get students to enroll in our school.\n\nThat right? But if they’re doin’ exhibition shows, is it fine that we’re the ones doin’ it?\nSure, we came outta Quarrel Festival as the unofficial victors, but is it really okay if it&#39;s not fine or Trickstar?\n\nThose guys are all busy. When it comes to giving a sense of stability, naturally, we AKATSUKI have the upper hand. It may seem self-congratulatory, but I believe we’re qualified.\n\nWell, it wouldn&#39;t be good to cause some kinda scene, and I can’t say for sure that Tenshouin or Trickstar wouldn’t try somethin’.\nOur role is to stand strong ‘n come up with steady, consistent results.\n\n\nHaha. It feels like we’ve become total government dogs, helpin’ out with propaganda.\n\nDon&#39;t say that. If we can attract enough new students who are suitable, we can rest easy even after we graduate. It’ll save Kanzaki and your precious Nagumo trouble.\n\nYou&#39;re pretty damn overprotective, arentcha?\nBut what’s got you in a panic then? From what you told me, it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s particularly urgent.\n\nAh, that’s right….. Errr, Kanzaki hasn’t shown up yet, has he?\n\nNope. Well, he&#39;s a punctual guy, so he&#39;ll turn up when the time comes.\n\nHmm. I agree with that point, but that doesn’t leave me with enough time... Kiryu, let me borrow some tools.\n\nHaahh? What&#39;s goin’ on? Didja suddenly wake up to the joy of sewing or somethin’?\nBeginners tend ta poke themselves on their fingertips ‘n stuff, so it&#39;s not really somethin’ idols should do, but…\nIf you&#39;re interested, I&#39;ll show ya how to do it.\n\nYou guys always leave the costumes to me, so it&#39;d be better if you could learn to do simple repairs an’ adjustments whenever I can’t be around to do it myself.\n\nNo, I’m not saying I want to sew. I figured you had a toolbox and materials you use whenever you needed to do building repairs— I’d like you to lend me something of that sort.\n\nAhh… It’s not like I mind, but you gotta tell me what’s goin’ on, man. Did the archery hall collapse or somethin’? That building’s startin’ to show its age in all sorts of places.\nThis dojo’s still a new building, but it seems that the archery hall’s been around since Yumenosaki was built.\nEvery so often the roof leaks and stuff, and I get sent to patch it up.\n\nJeez, sometimes I don&#39;t even know the kinda person I am. Sewing, carpentry... What should I do next, start up a lil’ home garden?\n\nDon’t be that way. You never know what sort of skills you’ll need as an idol.\n\nChapter 6\n\n……\n\nMm. Alright, all done.\n\n? What’s that you’re doin’? Looks like you’re painting somethin’... I thought you stopped drawin’, though?\n\nYes. But it’s unavoidable this time around.\nNow then, all that’s left to do is let it dry. I’ll dry it with one of our stage fans.\n\nThis thing’s pretty handy huh, since it can also be used as an everyday item. I’ll take one and do it with ya, flap flap… ♪\n\nMn~? The hell is this, a hanafuda card?\n\nYes. This and that happened, and it seems that there’s a hanafuda deck with just one card missing.\nThere’s a likelihood that it could turn into a bit of a problem if Kanzaki detected a card was missing, so I tried making a fake.\n\nI was wonderin’ what you were drawin’...\nWell, I guess AKATSUKI’s stages does tend to need props like that, and there’s lots of paper lyin’ around so makin’ a real-lookin’ fake would be possible, yeah..\n\nRight. I tried to replicate it from memory, but I think it turned out well enough all things considered.\n\nHaha. Those cards you’re talkin’ about are the ones I lent Lil’ Miss, yeah? Pretty sure I bought it cheap at a convenience store, actually.\nIt’d be pretty tough to make a fake if it were a genuine luxury set, but...\nThe designs on hanafuda sets are all basically the same in the end.\n\nKanzaki doesn&#39;t know about the card that’s missin’, so he won&#39;t get suspicious if you hand this one over as the real thing.\nThat guy’d believe it in an instant, even if it’s a total lie. Especially if it’s you tellin’ him that.\n\nYeah. I get worried every now and then… Will he be alright? Won’t he get tricked by bad actors?\n\n\nWhat are you talking about, Hasumi-dono?\n\nWhoa!? K-K-Kanzaki– When did you get behind me?\n\nJust now, a moment ago. I greeted you, but I suppose you didn’t notice since you were in the midst of conversation with Kiryu-dono.\n\nI didn’t notice either. If you were an assassin, we’d be finished by now. Pretty impressive, huh. Is the way you take your steps some kinda swordsmanship thing? Or is it from Japanese dance?\n\nHahaha. Perhaps it’s because I’m typically noisy... On the contrary, I get surprised: no one notices me when I conceal my presence.\n\nThat’s seriously the coolest, Kanzaki-dono! Pleaaase teach me how to do it– if anything, it’s a skill more necessary for a ninja than a martial artist…☆\n\n\nOhh? Anzu and… if I remember correctly… Sengoku? You guys were pretty imperceptible too, huh.\n\nHeheh, ninjas are specialists in covert operations, after all~♪\n\nIs that right? Hm, how amazing… Well, I get why Kanzaki is here at the dojo—I asked him to meet up after school—but what brings the two of you here?\n\nRight! As a matter of fact, we ended up hunting for a hanafuda card that was missing from its set!\nYou see, Anzu-dono was worried because she lost something that was lent to her.\n\nAhh... Fwoo~ Fwoo~ooo! (Blowing to dry the hanafuda card)\n\nWhat are you doing, Hasumi-dono? Are you imitating a Hyottoko?20\n\nHaha. AKATSUKI’s got such a formal vibe, he’s gotta get some good practice in makin’ silly faces.\nI wouldn’t call it a weakness, but Hasumi seems to mind it a lil’.\n\nI see… As you’d expect of Hasumi-dono, always doing his best to try and overcome his weaknesses.\nAnd so, for Hasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono, Anzu-dono… My duty is to relieve my honorable lords of their worries.\n\nWith that duty, I diligently searched and found… the missing hanafuda card~♪\n\n...!? What, are you serious? How did you find it?\n\nBy exhausting any and all means necessary. I was blessed to have Anzu-dono and Sengoku, they were immensely outstanding.\nWe borrowed a dog that was nearby to track it down by scent.\nWe looked at the lost-and-found records in the student council room, and asked all sorts of people if they knew anything about it.\n\nI would never have been able to do so on my own. – My, we truly went to such great lengths… I thought I would be late to the briefing.\n\nGh… This rascal’s competent at every fundamental level after all.\n\n\n(Pat, pat) Theeere, there, there. Wonderful, Kanzaki~!\nYou sure went and rendered all of my concerns and fears useless, didn’t you! You truly have your days where you’re like that, huh~♪\n\n? It’s an honor to receive such praise, Hasumi-dono\n\nOi. I’m feelin’ a lil’ left in the dark here. Or I guess, I don’t get what you were so worried about… Hasumi.\nIs it somethin’ you can’t talk about right now?\n\n… I’ll explain later.\nMore importantly— All of the members of AKATSUKI have gathered, so I’ll begin the briefing as planned.\nIf you’re free, Anzu, you can join in too and give us your thoughts. You’ve become relatively dependable lately.\n\nAhh… While yer at it Lil’ Miss, gimme your insight on this new uniform design too.\n\nWh-...What about me? What should I do? Should I go home since it doesn’t concern me?\n\n… No, it looks like Kanzaki depended on you for some kind of favor. If you don’t have any other plans, stay and give us your thoughts.\nWe’re all upperclassmen here, so our opinions may be skewed. I’d like a first year’s perspective as well.\n\nEpilogue 1\n\nWahoo! The briefing was efficient and pretty quick to finish, so we can play as much as we like~☆\n\nYes. As long as we are still children, plenty of sleep and plenty of play is our duty.\nNow now, everybody, show your hand!\n\nHand? Kanzaki-dono~ I don’t know the rules of hanafuda very well!\n\nAh, I’ll explain thoroughly as we go, so please rest easy.\nHachihachi is a variation of hanafuda that needs three players to play it. However, that means you, Anzu-dono and I are the ones who will have all the fun. I’m sorry that the other two will have nothing to do.\n\nIt’s not like I mind. I dunno the rules of hanafuda that well either, so it’ll be hard for me to play. Watchin’ you guys’ll be the fun for me.\n\nReally? … Heheh, I ended up collecting the autumn leaves set. Autumn is quite befitting for AKATSUKI.\n\nAhh, these are autumn leaves? I know bits and pieces about hanafuda, but don’t the flowers painted on the card correspond to the twelve months of the year?\n\nYes. Though, that’s why I’m not too sure whether you could call all of them “hana” fuda cards. There are paulownia, willow, pampas grass and the like– things that don&#39;t really give the impression they’re flowers.\nWell, plants usually produce flowers, but…\n\nNow that you mention it, the flower-ish parts of autumn leaves in general aren’t flowers. They’re leaves, huh…\nNihihi, earlier, I had a steamed bun21 outside. It was the same shape as the maple leaves on the card~♪\n\nYou have bits of food sticking on your cheek, Sengoku. Don’t move, I’ll get it.\n\nHaha. When you do something like that, it makes you look like close brothers.\n\nHmm... My younger brother back home is still young. Sengoku seems almost like a child, so perhaps it’s because they’re similar that I treat them the same way.\nEven though in reality, Sengoku is actually around the same age as me.\n\nAhh, y’got a little brother? Too bad it’s not a lil’ sister, eh, Kanzaki?\n\nNo, I wouldn’t say there is anything “too bad” about it in particular... Younger brothers are wonderful too, though it does get harrowing having to watch him while he’s in his prime of mischief.\n\nIs that right? It gets harrowing for us when we watch you too.\n\n\nMmnm… It’s a little regrettable that I am seen as a little brother. I’d be pleased beyond belief if you were to see me as a fellow companion you can stand beside and count on in the battlefield.\n\nAhh, right... I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make light of you.\nAs a companion, huh. If that’s the case, I think you need to know too.\n\nKanzaki. You can play hanafuda while you listen to me.\n\nMhm... But is it really okay to play around right now? I am having fun, but…\n\nYes. After our light briefing, we’ve made our decision on what direction to take for that “small job”, so it’s fine.\nWe came to the conclusion that we are AKATSUKI, no matter the occasion — And so, we should just do our usual routine.\nThere&#39;s no need for us to make some kind of spectacle about being original. That&#39;s not our duty anyway. Though of course, it is necessary to make various considerations and adjustments to attract the interest of the examinees.\n\nYes. As for me, the overwhelming victory of Quarrel Festival is fresh in my mind, so... I would like to do a performance based on that— without the loincloth22, of course.\n\nForget the loincloth. How incorrigible…\n… Quarrel Festival was a large-scale event that involved other units, so I’d say it’d be difficult to do something like that again and again.\nAnd if we storm into the venue with a fighting mikoshi23, we’ll probably put off the examinees.\nWe’re fine as we are.\n\nBut it seems that Kanzaki’s taken a liking to hanafuda, so it might be good to use it as design inspiration or something exactly like Quarrel Festival.\n\nYes. In hanafuda, inoshikacho — the boar, the deer and the butterfly — are three-of-a-kind. There are many times that those three, in combination with the red tanzaku cards and blue tanzaku cards24, are significant.\nI feel that as a trio unit, there are still a lot of elements left that AKATSUKI can take advantage of.\nRYUSEITAI could do a similar hanafuda theme for their own stage concept… Sengoku. Look, the best card combination is gokou– the five lights.25\n\nOoh, the five lights become one and form RYUSEITAI! Ahaha, judging by the look of it, the patterns are completely distinct from each other, just like us...♪\nIt might be good to try suggesting a project to everyone at some point… Well, no, I&#39;m only a first-year, so that might be too forward.\nStill, Taichou-dono asks, “Is there anything you&#39;d like to do?” pretty frequently, so I don’t think anyone would be particularly angry if I came up with a project either.26\n\n\nOh? Well, I imagine so. In the past, the environment around us made it difficult for people to do what they wanted, so…\nI imagine Morisawa doesn&#39;t want you all to go through the same troubles he did.\nIn the old days, Yumenosaki Academy was a much more oppressive environment than it is now. We wanted to reform that situation, so we desperately clawed our way to do so.\nOf course, it doesn’t mean that everything we did was right.\n\nWe wanted to create an environment where everyone could make their dreams come true– no... an environment where people wouldn’t have to give up, at the very least. But in the process, we took away many dreams.\nWe AKATSUKI were not the first to base our work on the concept of Japanese style.27\nKanzaki still hadn’t joined at that point, so I imagine he likely doesn’t know that.\nYou see, as we rose to prominence, other Japanese-style idols gradually changed course or simply disappeared…\n\nThis hanafuda set with a missing card was left behind by one of those idols.\nHe abandoned his props and the like and dropped out of school.\nIt would have been a waste to dump it all out, and he never came back to collect them either, so we kept them for safekeeping.\n\nEither way, he left after his dream fell apart. It might be self-centered to think things like “It’s our fault. We chased him away”, but…\nI can’t help myself from thinking about it even now.\n\nIf only I was able to write a script where nobody was left unhappy, but I just didn&#39;t have that kind of skill.\n\nEpilogue 2\n\nWhen that Japanese-style idol was about to leave, he hurled the one-point willow card at me and Kiryu while we were singing on stage.\nThe song was playing so insanely loud, I couldn&#39;t hear whatever parting words he had for us, but…\nKanzaki seems to be familiar with hanafuda cards, so he probably knows this, but the one-point willow card has a strange picture drawn on it.\n\nHanafuda cards are fundamentally beautiful and elegant in design, but compared to that, this card has a distinct, ominous design.28\nThere are various theories, but it looks like a stage that was destroyed by a great disaster… that’s what I think, at least.\nI imagine the act of throwing it was a curse, like hoping that our stage would be destroyed in the same way.\n\nBecause of all that, one single card was missing from this hanafuda set. I thought it’d been thrown out with the garbage when the stage was emptied out, but…\nI never expected it would actually be found.\n\nIt reminded me of unpleasant things. Right now, we’re living on good momentum with just about no complaints, but…\nSins committed in the past will never disappear just like that.\nI imagine there’s nothing else to do but carry it and keep moving forward.\n\nIt was a pretty shocking incident for me at the time… And I thought Kanzaki would be upset if he knew, so I couldn’t get myself to mention it.\nI even made a fake hanafuda card and tried to deceive him.\nI’m a coward for trying it… But, all I wanted to do was give you something as pure as I could.\nYou have a brilliant, promising future. It doesn’t need such heavy, gloomy things in it.\n\nIt seems I was a fool to have thought that. There was no way I could’ve just kept it hidden from you forever…\nYou&#39;re genuine and reckless, and you&#39;re a good kid who believes what others say without question, but you&#39;re not stupid.\n\n\n……\n\n… What is it? You look displeased, Kanzaki. If you don&#39;t follow what I’m trying to say, I&#39;ll go back and rework it and explain it any number of times you need.\n\nNo, there’s no need. It’s just… what you’re saying doesn’t match up, Hasumi-dono.\nThe missing one-point willow card... Where do you think we found it?\n\nHmm. I am pretty curious about that, since I was so sure it had already been tossed and burnt to ashes at the landfill.\nI’m shocked it still existed at all.\n\n\nMnn~... So this is that one-point willow card, huh.\nHasumi’s talkin’ about it reminded me of it too. I feel like all sorts of things have changed since then.\nHere I thought I could walk around proud under the sun. Guess things aren’t that peachy, huh?\n\nMnn~... The one-point willow card’s a lil’ dirty. It&#39;s just that it got worn out over time, it&#39;s got some grime on it. Don’t tell me it got buried underground, did it?\n\nIndeed it did. To be more precise, it was buried in something like a jar underground. Since the only thing we were looking for was the card, we buried the vase itself back in the ground.\nWith all of the digging and burying we did, the mud stuck to it. But, well, you can’t tell it’s there unless it’s pointed out, so I didn’t consider it a hindrance to playing the game.\n\nHmm? There was a jar underground? Why was the missing card in such a place...?\n\nAh... Isn&#39;t that called a time capsule or somethin’? What else was in the jar, Kanzaki?\n\nHmm. I didn’t look for more details, but there were papers of all sizes inside of it... that is to say, it mainly consisted of letters.\nThe jar itself was tightly sealed, and it was difficult to open it.\n\nThat’s right... Now that you mention it, it is what you call a “taimu kapuseru”.\nA game where you write letters and the like to your future self, bury it in the ground, dig it up years later, open it, and see what it says…\n\nIf that&#39;s the case, I did something bad by digging it up. All of the things they buried were something they were looking forward to unsealing someday.\nBut at the same time, everything makes sense now. This card was bundled in note paper, which had a short entry written on it.\n\nThe contents didn’t seem like a curse against Hasumi-dono by any means, nor did it seem to be anything like a grudge. That&#39;s why I said that it didn&#39;t match up a moment ago.\n\n... What was written on it?\n\nRight. In summary, it said, “Do you and your spouse still live together happily?”\n\nSpouse... Was that guy married? And that’s possibly why he dropped out of school?\n\nMhm. At the same time, there were some very small impressions of Hasumi-dono’s stage performance too. It said something like, “I couldn’t perform on a stage like that myself, and I was envious of how wonderful and shining he was”.\nOn those grounds, well, it&#39;s probably true that he had reservations about Hasumi-dono and threw the card at him.\nI feel as though it’s that… when he saw you, men of high rank, going down the same path as him, he might’ve lost heart and given up on his dream.\n\nPerhaps it can be said that it was your fault, Hasumi-dono, but… whether it can truly be called a sin is something I’m not so sure of…\nOn that note paper, there was something else to the last sentence too—\n\n“This card is me. Engrave that in your memory”... What on earth does that mean? Is he comparing his broken dreams to the merciless pattern of the willow card?\n\n… Who knows. The person in question isn’t here, and I don&#39;t know his contact information, so there’s no way to confirm it.\n\nHmm. The willow card is versatile; it can change into other forms if it wishes.29\nBut after it changes, it’s called a junk card.\nWhen he says, “This card is me,” he might have been comparing himself to the one-point willow card, the lowest and weakest of them all… A card considered junk even if it changes.\n\n\nHm~m, even so, there’s the “Engrave that in your memory” part... I don&#39;t get what he wants to say, it&#39;s too difficult to understand. While that does sound very much like how hanafuda works, the real truth is still obscured in the dark.\nWe have no choice but to interpret it our way and move forward, carrying all of the pain, scars, and curses with us.\nI can&#39;t turn back the hands of the clock, and I’d rather avoid pinning my worries onto my future self in a time capsule.\n\nAt the very least, I&#39;ll never forget it again... I&#39;ll commit the one-point willow card to heart.\n\nNo. I’ll never forget the dreams that didn&#39;t come true, the ones that we stole away with no return.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Natsume says &quot;Good Afternoon&quot; in English.

Let’s stop right here and take a short break!\n\nEh…? Wait a sec, what’s that mean…? Isn’t practice already over…?\n\nYep. Indoor practice is over, but next we’ll practice outside!\n\nEh…~ I never heard anything about this, though...\n\nIt’s rare the weather’s this great, so it’d be a waste if we didn’t practice outside! Besides, look! As you might’ve noticed, there wasn’t as much space to move around in the auditorium.\nWe’ll take a thirty-minute break, and meet outside the auditorium after we’re done!\n\nehehe, let’s go [rehydrate] during break~♪\n\nHmm~mm, it doesn’t feel like enough time for a good break. What about you guys? What’re you gonna do, Midori-kun?\n\nMoving around feels like a pain, so I’ll just hang out here and chill…\n\nAhaha. Midori-kun, you’re dozing off. You’ll catch a cold if you fall asleep just like that, y’know~? I’ll go fetch some blankets and stuff from the green room!\n\nAh, Tetora-kun, I’ll come help you!\n\nAhh, it’s alright. It’s not like they’ll be heavy, so you should take a break too, Sengoku-kun.\n\n(Mm~mm, he left. Taichou-dono and everyone else is taking a break, so perhaps I should just sit around and relax, as well…?)\n(But, I don’t come here often~ so maybe I could explore and look around a bit?)\n\n(... Yeah! There might be unexpected discoveries that lie in wait for me! Time to go on an expedition~♪)\n(I don&#39;t know anything about sewing. Is there any other way I could cheer her up…?)\n\n\n    Location: Auditorium Hallway\n\n\n(Hmm, I’m always amazed to see how big that TV screen is. They display live shows on this screen, right?)\n\n(When I first saw it, I was so overwhelmed with excitement that I shouted out loud, and everyone looked at me. I felt so embarrassed.)\n\n… Hm?\nTransfer Student-dono? Ahh, it really is you. What are you doing in a place like this?\n\nHmm… So you’re doing needlework.\nSpeaking of which, I heard from Isara-dono that Transfer Student-dono is the one who makes Trickstar’s outfits.\nWhat are you sewing right now?\n\nAh, am I disturbing you by any chance?\n\nI’m not? T-That’s good to know, then~♪\n\nUm, Transfer Student-dono. This might be too forward of me to say, but you seem down.\nAre you perhaps worried about something? If you’re fine speaking with me, I could lend you an ear~?\n\nHm, hm. It’s troubling you that the outfit you’re working on isn’t turning out how you wanted it to?\n……\n\n(Hmm~ I really am just listening to what she has to say…)\n(I don&#39;t know anything about sewing. Is there any other way I could cheer her up…?)\n\n\nAh—! Look, look! Don’t I look like a ninja if I wear it like this~♪\nHm? You look puzzled, Transfer Student-dono. You’re not familiar with ninjas?\nNinjas run with a scarf wrapped around their necks~♪ 1 Well, it’s actually a hood they wear, not a scarf, though.\nAh, but this one’s pretty long, maybe I could use it as a hood…?\n\nFwah? This isn’t for playing around, so I should give it back?\n\nT-That was rude of me! Are you angry with me, Transfer Student-dono? I’m so sorry~!\nOhh, you’re petting my head for some reason…\n\nEh, you’re thanking me for giving you encouragement? Ehehe, was I able to be of service a little?\nHm? Ahh, I have practice with RYUSEITAI, so that’s why I’m in the school’s idol uniform.\nTransfer Student-dono, I just got an idea!\nIf it’s alright, how about you come watch RYUSEITAI’s practice? Maybe if you take a break from your work, your progress will get better…!\n\nWhoa, you’re interested~? ♪\n\nOhh, really, what’s making you keep petting me…?\nBut, well, if it makes Transfer Student-dono smile, then I’m also happy…?\n\nMm, so Transfer Student-dono will be here for a while?\nWe’ll be gathering outside the auditorium in a little bit, so... I’ll call for you when the time comes.\n\nUntil then, please keep doing your work. If there’s anything you need, I’ll buy it for you!\nDon’t hold back, please think of me as your hands and feet and use me as such~♪\n\nChapter 2\n\n    Location: Outside the Auditorium\n\n\nWe all met up right on time!\nNow then, let’s move locations and get practice started…\n\nThat’s what I’d like to say, but before that, why is the Transfer Student here?\n\nAh, I invited her. Transfer Student-dono was interested in how we do our practice, so she’s here to observe us.\n\nI see, I see! Having a spectator would be a big help! Oh, no, you don’t have to look so nervous.\nAll you have to do is cheer for us, like “Do your best, don’t give up!”, Transfer Student. Your cheers will give us strength…☆\n\nchiaki~ since it’s such a lovely opportunity to have transfer student-san watch us, why don’t we put on our personal [unit] uniforms?\n\nOhh, that’s nice idea! Everyone, it’s time to transform!\n\nEhhh…~ I just wanna go home at this point, though…?\n\nThere’s no other choice but to give in, Midori-kun. Taichou never listens when it gets to this point.\n\nAh~ I’m so depressed… I wanna die…\n\nEveryone~? Transfer Student-dono is kindly turning away from us. So let’s change while her back’s turned.\n\n\n    Location: Fountain\n\n\npuka, puka…♪ ehehe, the [water’s] cold, it feels so nice…♪\n\nOhh… The first thing Shinkai-dono did was approach the water fountain, huh?\nActually, it looks like he’ll jump in any second now, but is it really alright if no one stops him…?\n\nKanata. I know you want to get in the water, but hold it in for now.\n\nit’s okay~\ni [hydrated] myself during our break, so~ i won’t [dry] up just yet.\n\nEhh, what does that mean? I did think it was a little odd how drenched you were just from sweat alone, but…\nUu, it’s so incomprehensible that it’s scary~\n\nAhaha, as you’d expect from the “Three Eccentrics”, huh? Anyways, we can’t keep Transfer Student-san waitin’ any longer.\n\nThat’s true. Alright guys, let’s start by greeting the Transfer Student enthusiastically! Thank you for coming to spectate our activities…☆\n\nAhh, right… The setting’s a hero show, wasn’t it… Egh, people passing by are looking this way…\n\nOssu! We’re idols, gettin’ attention’s a good thing!\n\nWell, to be fair, that’s a much different kind of attention…\n\nAh, Transfer Student-dono is cheering us on with a “Do your best~!”.\n\nHeheh, it’s only embarrassing if you think it’s embarrassing. I’ll also make an enthusiastic pose. Nin nin…♪\n(Ehehe. With my ninjutsu, I vanquished the villain spectacularly!)\n(Well, the villains are members of RYUSEITAI too, so even though it’s a play, I feel a little bad taking them down.)\n(But then again, yesterday, I played the villain instead, and fell victim to Shinkai-dono’s offensive.2)\n\n(This feels more like playing hero than actual idol activities, so sometimes I wonder if it really is alright with things like this...)\n(But it’s fun! That’s the most important feeling, without a doubt~♪)\n\nOhh, I feel myself overflowing with power thanks to the Transfer Student’s encouragement!\nAaalright! We defeated the final boss! Thank you! We’ve protected the peace of the Earth!\nAs long as we’re here, justice will never perish…☆\n\nMhm, with that, practice is over for today. You did a great job, everyone!\n\nThen I can go home now, right… ‘Kay, bye…\n\nMm. I see you’re about to hurry home, but we’re actually going to eat together after this!\nWe’ll celebrate the fruits of our labor~☆ If it’s alright, why don’t you come too, Transfer Student?\n\nOh? Watching our performance got your creative juices flowing?\n\nNo, no, no need to thank me at all!\nIt’s a shame that you can&#39;t join us, Transfer Student-dono, but if you say you want to go back and start sewing right away, we can&#39;t stop you.\nHm? Yeah, Kiryu-dono made our RYUSEITAI uniforms for us!\n\n\nOhh, from now on, you’re going to make them too? That’s all we could ever want, Transfer Student-dono~!\n\nYeah, we’d be saved plenty! Thank you, Transfer Student!\n\nI hope you'll come and watch us again, Transfer Student-dono~♪ Promise, okay~?\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Ninjas use zukin (hoods) for concealing their faces.↑ RYUSEITAI plays heroes like this in Hero Game."},{"title":"Pon de Beach Commu","url":"/translation//pon_de_beach/","content":"\n\n\n \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\tHibiki\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Writer\n                \n                \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Associated Card\n                \n                Pon de Beach\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n(Today&#39;s job is an event appearance at an amusement park.

It seems like the recording finished without a hitch. He’s such a sincere guy, going to the trouble of reporting back for me…)\n(One from Kanzaki too… “If there is anything you need, I&#39;ll buy it on the way back.”)\n\n(I bought everything I needed yesterday. … “No problems in particular have popped up”.)\n\n(I was trying to be mindful about my health, so I didn’t expect to catch a cold of all things.)\n(I’ve inconvenienced Kiryu, Kanzaki, and Anzu too… How pathetic of me.)\n(I need to get better as soon as I can and get back to work…)\n\n\n(Whispering) I’m baaack~\nAh, Hasumi-senpai. I see that you’re awake. I bought some jello and fruit~ Are you feeling any better?\n\n(Cough) From yesterday? Better, more or less, but I’m still not up to shape.\n\nIf that’s the case, I guess your temperature hasn’t gone down yet, huh… Excuse me for a moment.\n\nHm? What are you doing?\n\n\nMn~nn, it looks like you still have a strong fever.\n\n… Shino. If you’re taking my temperature, you’ll get something more precise if you use a thermometer rather than putting your hand on my forehead.\n\nAh– I’m so sorry! I’ve done it when my little brother and sister had colds, so it was just a force of habit.\n\nI’m not particularly angry. Anyways, could you grab the thermometer on the table for me? \nWhen I’m finished taking my temperature, I’m going to make some porridge. I haven’t eaten anything since yesterday. Figures, I’m on an empty stomach.\n\nIf that’s the case, I’ll make it. Please get some rest, Hasumi-senpai.\n\nNo, you don’t need to go that far to help—... (Cough!)\n\nHasumi-senpai, you’re certifiably sick right now, so you absolutely cannot push yourself!\nBesides, I tend to get help from you on a regular basis, Senpai, so please let me return the favor.\n\n… Is that right? If that’s the case, I’ll allow myself to depend on your kindness, Shino.\n\nAlright. I’ll give you a shout when the porridge is done~♪\n\n(I think it’s because Shino usually calls Nito by “Ni~chan”, that… he gave me the impression that he’s a little brother, but…)\n(Doing this, Shino looks to be something of a diligent “Onii-chan” himself. He must be a good older brother who cares for his siblings back home.)\n\n(... A message from Isara this time? “How are you holding up?”)\n\n(This is from Eichi, one from Sakuma… Honestly, the messages just won’t stop today. All it is is a simple cold, and yet every last one of them is too worried.)\n\n\n   Fade to black\n\n\nWahh, I see that you ate it all up!\n\nYes, it was absolutely delicious. Once again, thank you for making this for me.\n\nIt makes me happy to hear you say that too. I sincerely hope you enjoyed it ♪\n\nNow then… I’ve had my meal, so I’ll get a little more rest.\n\n(Typically, I’d never do something like lie down right after eating, but…)\n(Now that I’m full, I feel rather cozy. I’ll definitely be out like a light at this rate.)\n\n… (Humming) ♪\n\n\n……\n\n… Shino, why did you start singing? You can’t possibly be planning to sing a lullaby are you?\n\nI—... I’m so sorry… Was I being too noisy?\n\nNo, I wasn’t saying that.\nBut, I’m not a child either. I obviously wouldn’t need a lullaby.\n\n\nShino-kun, you’ve returned, huh.\n\nYes, I finished my job early. Welcome back to you too, Hidaka-senpai.\n\nGlad to be back. And how’s the cold, Hasumi-senpai?\n\nMy symptoms have settled down considerably compared to yesterday. I’ve started to have an appetite as well, so I just finished eating some porridge Shino made for me.\n\nThat’s good. As a matter of fact, I got all sorts of goods for you too, Hasumi-senpai.\n\nYou too, huh? There’s no need for every last one of you to worry this much…\n\nEveryone is worried about you, Hasumi-senpai. … So, what did you bring, Hidaka-senpai?\n\nI asked Isara to loan me some manga he recommended. You won’t get bored if you have this, right Hasumi-senpai?\n\nWell, yes, there may be times where it gets boring, but…\nI don’t think I’m well enough yet to read it right now, so after, I’ll…\n\nLeave it to me. I’m going to read the manga aloud.\n\n\nRead it out loud!?\n\nYes, all you have to do is listen dutifully, Hasumi-senpai.\nShino-kun. I’ll be in charge of this character, so you take care of the…\n\nHold it, Hidaka! The art of manga is about both the drawings and the dialogue. The charm is halfway lost if you just listen to it being read to you!\n\nI intend to read the sound effects1 properly, though…?\n\nThat’s not the problem!\n\nUm, Hidaka-senpai. I think Hasumi-senpai’s right. I wonder if reading manga out loud’s a little too hard…\n\nDo you understand, Hidaka? I’ll accept your feelings, so now…\n\nIf you’re reading something out loud, I think a novel would be way better ♪\n\nHm. Is that right?\n\nDon’t nod your head to that. I don’t need anything being read to me in the first place.\nFor now, I’d like for you to just let me sleep in peace. I don’t need any more interference.\n\nBut, I won’t feel good abo—…\n\nHave I not said it again and again— I said that I didn’t need… (Cough, cough!)\n\nHasumi-senpai…!? Are you alright?\n\n… Sorry. I tried to think up all sorts of ideas for Hasumi-senpai, but it seems like I was getting nowhere with it.\nWhenever something comes up for me and Shino-kun, you always lend a hand even though you’re in such a busy position.\nYou ended up getting a cold that put you out of order, so I thought now was the perfect time to repay you, but…\n\n\n… No, I was the one who got worked up. I turned down your guys’ kindness without considering your feelings very well.\nI’m thankful for your guys’ overattentiveness.\nBut, like I said a little while ago, my symptoms have been settling down. I’d be happy if you could just let me rest quietly for now.\n\n… I understand. Instead, if there’s anything I can do, please rely on me without hesitating.\n\nAh, another message from HoldHands…\n\nDid something happen?\n\nIt seems the remote to the air-conditioner isn’t in the common room.2\nIt seems that although they know that I have a cold, they still thought it was best to report it to the dorm supervisor anyway.\n\nBe that as it may, I can’t go and look for a missing remote right now. I’ll just let everyone in the dorms know…\n\n… I see.\n\nWhat is it, Hidaka?\n\nHasumi-senpai can’t move right now, so Seisoukan is missing a dorm administrator. I would say that’s a problem for everyone.\nSo, until you get better, I will carry out that role in your place… From here on out, I am the substitute dorm administrator.\n\n\nHold it, there’s no “substitute dorm administrator” positio—\n\nLeave it to me, Hasumi-senpai. I will find that remote without fail!\n\nHe left right away.\n\nYeah, there was no time to stop him. … I just hope he doesn’t make too much of a ruckus while he‘s at it, though.\n\nIt’s Hidaka-senpai, so I don’t think we have to worry that much, but…\nI’ll go look for it with him. Please take your time getting rest, Hasumi-senpai.\n\n(Sigh) Honestly, how incorrigible.\nI’ve got to get better as soon as I can…\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ オノマトペ (onomonepeia) in manga are written sound effects for actions, feelings and sounds (ex. ドキドキ, doki-doki, someone's heart racing).↑ Keito's dorm adminstrator duties (and missing remote controls) get mentioned in Dominant"},{"title":"Intelligence | Disclosure Chapter 4 (Partial Translation)","url":"/translation//intelligence/","content":"\nPartial Translation Disclaimer: This is a partial translation of the Intelligence cross-scout gacha story.

Kaoru mentions Kanata and AOUMI Aquarium as a place Yuzuru could learn from, and Yuzuru reserves tickets for the two of them to see him the next day.\nWhen Kaoru and Yuzuru get to AOUMI Aquarium, Jun is there with Kanata to prep for an aquarium photo shoot. Kanata tells them that he's on an investigation regarding Mendako1 aliens that have been appearing in Seisoukan dorms.\nThe Mendako alien costume has been making the rounds around the dorm without Kanata's permission, so he's in the aquarium to check the storage room. Yuzuru cooberates the story: he's experienced a past sighting with Eichi: a Mendako alien dancing around in the courtyard. Kanata returns with his Mendako costume, so it hasn't been stolen. With the matter settled, Yuzuru and Kanata discuss business.\nLater that night, Kaoru goes into the kitchen for water and sees a group of Mendako aliens in the dorm commons performing a ritual around the table.\nIntelligence Chapter 4\n\n    Location: Seisoukan Dorm Common Room\n\n\n\n    The next day\n\nYou saw the Mendako aliens2 gathered together...?\n\nYeah. I happened to be looking at the common room from the kitchen when I saw them last night.\nThere were a few Mendako aliens circled around the dining table... It was like they were holding a ritual.\n\nBut isn’t it really weird~? A mysterious group of mascot costumes inside Seisoukan, appearing and disappearing at will...\nI can’t understand who on earth it is, and why the hell they’re doing it.\n\nIndeed, since it’s hard to see what they gain by doing this.\n\nDo you have any clue, Kanata-kun?\n\ncould it be that you’re suspicious of me, kaoru...?\n\nyou’re heartless...! i have had [nothing to do with this]...!\n\nNo, no, it’s not that– nothing’s coming to mind for me, so I just wanted to hear your opinion, Kanata-kun.\nYou have the most enthusiasm for spreading the wonders of mendako out of all of us, so I figured you might have an idea!\n\n… really? hm~ well, if that’s what you meant it is fine, but…\ni hardly ever [walk around] in a mascot [costume], so i do not know either.\n\nYeah, I thought so~ So there’s nothing we can do…\nI guess the only way to get the truth is to catch the person in question and make them confess, huh~?\n\nThat&#39;s kinda disturbing~ Well, I get that it’s creepy if people in mascot suits materialized in someone’s living space out of nowhere, though.\nIf we could just understand the goal of the Mendako aliens, we might get a clue on who they truly are.\n\nWell then, how about the four of us investigate the Mendako alien eyewitness accounts together?\nThey seem to have been making appearances here many times recently, so I imagine there must be a number of witnesses around.\n\n[good idea]. if we collect some [eyewitness reports], we might get a better idea of the why they have been on the [move] lately.\n\nwhen it comes to someone who might know more [about this]…\n\nHow about someone like Hasumi-kun?\n\nAh…~ Oh yeah, ‘cause Hasumi-senpai’s the dorm supervisor, right?\nI usually check with him on the dorm rules, so maybe he’s got reports of sightings too.\n\nWell then, it’s settled. Let us start by speaking with Keito-sama and seeing what he has to say.\n\n\nI was wondering what the commotion was here… So you’re talking about that thing?\nI’m certainly aware of the gist of it.. This is about the Mendako aliens that appear night after night, right?\nThey haven’t been a nuisance for people, so I’ve also been keeping an eye out for them, but… Did they cause any trouble?\n\nAs we thought, Keito-sama has heard about them as well.\nBoth myself and Kaoru-sama witnessed them, but it was neither a bother nor a danger; the strange sight merely startled us and nothing more.\nHowever, we were wondering if Keito-sama might have any idea what on earth they’re doing.\n\nWe figured if we could get some more eyewitness reports, we’d be able to understand what those guys are getting out of dressing up like Mendako aliens. Do you know anything about it, Hasumi-kun?\n\nHm. Since I’m the dorm supervisor, I&#39;ve been gathering testimonies, but...\nTo be honest, I feel as if none of them are conclusive.\nIt’s just bizarre rumors going around, like that they were having a nighttime takoyaki3 party in the dorm, or that they were chanting mysterious spells, or that they were sprawled out and lying down flat.\n\nIt’s hard to say whether or not they&#39;re nuisances when I can’t even begin to describe what’s going on, so it frustrates me not being able to do my job and lecture them on it....\n\n\ni feel that at this point, they are already being [nuisances] though.\nbut i am also someone who seems [strange] from [other people’s] perspectives, so~ i don’t think we should [crack down on it] that much.\n\nIt&#39;s not up to one single resident to decide what’s normal and what’s weird, after all. I wouldn’t be able to get comfortable either if I wasn’t allowed to do weight training in the room.\n\nHowever, considering how careful they are in ensuring they are within the line that will not incur a scolding, it seems as if their actions are thoroughly planned.\nAll the more intriguing.\n\nThen should we go and interview the witnesses next?\nGoing around on foot is the classic way to investigate~ Maybe the ringleader of the Mendako aliens himself will be among them.\n\nLet us do so. This is not an operation you can conduct alone, and there may be a likelihood that they are recruiting people who have discovered their true identity.\nKeito-sama, would you be able to tell us the identity of the witnesses?\n\nHmm... I guess it’s fine. I don’t think there’s a need to hide any sources of information in this case.\nI’m hoping for a full portrait of the situation too. I&#39;m counting on you.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \nTranslation Notes\n↑ Mendako (or flapjack octopus) are a species of umbrella octopus.↑ As Kanata explains at the beginning of Disclosure Chapter 3, the costume they're talking about was originally used by Chiaki for hero shows, most notably in Supernova Live.

As soon as my mind wanders, it goes right back to thinking about work.)\n(I decided to set aside the whole day for a break. For the sake of the future, I have to look after my mind and body right now.)\n\n(Now then, which should I go with next? I’m getting a little tired of going through some of my backlog.)\n(Reading something I wouldn’t usually pick up might be a good palette cleanser.

It’s true that there are a lotta people who use this place. And that’s exactly why I’ve taken advantage of it as a good hiding spot~☆\n\nI sure hope so. (Sighs)... Why do I get these grades all the time? I’m sick of it!\nIt was last second, but I still basically studied for the test overnight. Am I just bad at this kinda thing?\n\nSpeaking of grades, our Hiro-kun’s an idiot and yet he’s the top of his class ’cause of his grades.\nSo when I asked him for tips about studying, he was just like, &quot;How do you manage to get those kinds of grades? I&#39;m curious!&quot;\n\nThat’s what I’d like to know. It pisses me off~!\n\nAhaha. Being close to a genius is tough, right?\n\nYeah… So that’s why I was happy that you heard me out and gave me advice~♪\nI’m hesitant to just throw it away as kindling, but I don&#39;t wanna put it somewhere people can see either.\n\nMhmhm, I know how you feel. When I got a bad grade, I also looked around everywhere for a place to hide the answer sheet—\nThat’s when I realized this book room feels like a “Flunk-out’s Paradise”…♪\n\n(Hm… I don’t have a single clue what they’re on about. All I can glean from them is that this is a dumb conversation.)\n(But, there’s no doubt in my mind they’re scheming something.

Sorry.\n\nYou’re beyond help. To think, a cover-up orchestrated not just by Aoi and Shiratori, but Nagumo too.\n\nIt’s ‘cuz these kinds of grades aren’t manly, so I can’t let Taishou find out about ‘em. Uuu…\n\n(Kiryu would get these kinds of grades too… But for the sake of his honor, I won’t bring it up.)\n\nThere’s only so much space between the sofa cushions. You wouldn’t have been able to stash as many as you wanted in there.\nBesides, this conduct would’ve been sniffed out sooner or later. What exactly did you plan on doing when that time came?\n\nWe didn’t think about it at all… If we could think that far ahead, we wouldn’t be getting grades as bad as these~\n\nHm… If that’s how it is, then you just need to not get any bad grades.\nToday’s my day off. I’ll stay and help you all study.\n\nEh? You’d do that, Hasumi-senpai?\n\nI kinda wanna refuse or something…\n\n‘Cuz senpai seems like the type to be real intense with his lectures, so…?\n\nHmph, so you are aware. I’ll open up the “Keito Lecture: Spinoff Edition” as a special occasion for you all.\nEach of you, go grab some stationary.

In order to help the Producer get to know him more, the two of them head to Okinawa.\n\n  \n  \n    Ibuki's entrance into AKATSUKI has insensitive parallels to the history between Japan and the Ryukyu Islands, specifically the annexation of Ryukyu into Okinawa from 1872-1879 onward. Click for more information\n  \n  \n  AKATSUKI is a unit embodied by 和 (wa, lit. harmony, but also a self-designator for Japan). The word 和風 (wafu, Japanese style) comes from 和. During the Meiji Restoration, 和 was central to Japan’s efforts to unify and assimilate new territories under a shared cultural identity. On top of his membership, Ibuki's active pursuit of 本当の和風 (true Japanese-style) being the reason he pursues AKATSUKI is inappropriate, bearing this in mind.\n  \n     Additionally, the Ryukyu Disposition was driven by military interests, particularly securing Japan's southern borders from other nations. In Okinawan schools, national pride was linked to serving Japan’s military goals. This had devastating consequences, particularly during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. This in mind, having Ibuki join the self-proclaimed \"war unit\" is also inappropriate. \n  Read the full-length analysis here: Unpacking Shinsei (新生) AKATSUKI; An Extended Translation Note and Analysis.\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nSorry, I&#39;m a little late. Has practice already started?\n\nOhh, you’re finally here. We were just talkin&#39; about startin&#39; up.\n\nStill, Danna1 that&#39;s pretty unusual of ya to arrive at the meeting time right on the dot.\n\nRight. I had a briefing session with the higher-ups, and it ran a little long.\n\nSee, Kanzaki? I told ya not to be so worried about him.\n\nMm. ... I had thought that Hasumi-dono would have let us know in advance if he was going to be late.\nSince that was not the case today, I thought that perhaps something had happened to him.\n\nThat’s my bad. I should have let you know, even if I was going to make it on time.\n\nNo, it was just me worrying too much. There is no need to fret over it, Hasumi-dono.\n\nMore importantly, the real issue here is Taki...! We are about to begin practice, and yet he is a complete no-show!\n\nCome to think of it, I haven&#39;t seen him around for a while, huh?\n\n... Wait, maybe I should be asking— why is Anzu here?\n\nSeems like she&#39;s got business with Taki regarding his exclusive outfit.\n\nI see. Now that Taki’s become an ES-affiliated idol, that means his turn has finally come to have an exclusive outfit made for him.\nWhat? How is Taki doing?\n\nWell, he&#39;s as well as well can be. Whether it&#39;s practice or on stage, he&#39;s absolutely brimming with energy.\n\nAnd he is always cutting it close arriving for practice, just like today…\n\nNow, now. As long as he makes it in time, it&#39;s fine, ain’t it?\n\nYou seem a little restless, Anzu. Something didn&#39;t happen regarding Taki&#39;s exclusive outfit, did it?\nNo? The exclusive outfit’s even in the design stage?\n\n(Hmm. She still seems a little anxious, though.)\n(What&#39;s more, if she had business with Taki, she could have him meet up with her elsewhere. Why come here herself?)\n(Something&#39;s nagging me about it but... I figure it’ll make sense once Taki gets here.)\n\n\nManaged to make it right on time, huh~?\n\nYou&#39;re late, Taki! Time and time again we’ve been telling you, give yourself time to come!\n\nI&#39;m sorry~ Kanzaki-san! I caught a real big ol’ fish, you see~?\nSo I had to go back to Seisoukan, that&#39;s why I got here right on the dot~\n\nHm? Why&#39;s Anzu-neenee here? Did you come to observe our practice or something?\n\nSeems Lil&#39; Miss is waitin’ here so she could talk to ya about your exclusive outfit.\n\nExclusive outfit…\n\nOhh~ I remember now~! We talked lots about it the other day, right~\n\nDid you finish it already? If so, you gotta show me pronto~♪\n\n... Hm? Why’re ya lookin’ all relieved like that? What’s up?\nHuh? What was I doing this afternoon?\n\nWell, I didn&#39;t have any work today, so I took it easy and went out fishing~♪\n\nCellphone? Ohh~ Now that you mention it, I haven’t seen it around today~? I think I forgot it in my room.\n\nYou&#39;ve been trying to reach me since morning, and you were worried over the lack of response?\n\nSo that&#39;s what it was. That explains why Lil&#39; Miss came directly to us.\n\nIs that so? I didn&#39;t think about that at all~?\n\nWhat are you doing, causing Anzu-dono worry with such behavior!\n\n(Sigh) So that&#39;s what it was... It&#39;s no wonder Anzu was acting weird.\n\nWelp, this is all on you, Taki.\nYou need to make sure you keep your phone on you as much as you can. Not just for Lil&#39; Miss, but there&#39;s gonna be times when work is gonna need to reach you quickly.\n\n\nMn~ I got it alreaaady~ I&#39;m real sorry for making you worry, Anzu-neenee.\n\nHow incorrigible... You too, Anzu, you can be a little more strict with him too.\n\n... You’d like to have the designs you have for the exclusive outfit checked out real quick so you don&#39;t dip into our practice time?\n\nI wonder what kinda outfits you came up with~ I can&#39;t wait to see~♪\nOoh, all of these designs are for my exclusive outfit~?\n\nHaha. They don’t surprise me, or should I say, they&#39;re all designed beautifully in Japanese-style, huh?\n\n... Hmm. Was Taki&#39;s request &quot;true Japanese-style&quot;?2 If so, outfits like these would certainly meet those demands.\n\nAnd even then, while each outfit has Japanese elements, each and every one holds its own individuality.\nHow about it, Taki. Were there any designs you took a liking to?\n\nMn~nn... If I had to choose, I guess this one~?\nWhat, must you put it like that? How disrespectful, Anzu-dono came up with these outfits for you!\n\nI&#39;m super grateful to Anzu-neenee, okay~ All of these outfits have the Japanese vibe I love, you know?\n\nBut, it feels like it&#39;s missing something.\n\nSo this isn&#39;t the kinda &quot;true Japanese-style&quot; you were thinking of?\n\nI don’t really know how to explain it, but it just doesn&#39;t fit right somehow~? They’re not bad or anything, they’re just missing something.\n\n... Looking at Anzu, it seems like she shares the same thought.\nThat’s probably why there’s so many designs, because she was worried about coming up with an exclusive outfit for Taki that would be satisfying.\n\nYou thought about it to the very last minute, but in the end, you couldn&#39;t come up with anything solid, huh.\nGuess that&#39;s why you wanted him to look over the designs as soon as possible.\n\n&quot;Doesn&#39;t fit&quot;, you say...\n\nWhat&#39;s up, Kanzaki. Did something come to mind?\n\n... No. This is Taki&#39;s exclusive outfit, so it should be up to Taki to decide whatever it is he wants to wear.\n\nI don&#39;t really mind, though~? If there’s something that came to mind, tell me, Kanzaki-san.\n\nTaki&#39;s said so too. ... Besides, I suspect we have the same opinion.\n\nYou too, Hasumi-dono? ... Then, while I am aware this is rude, I&#39;ll say it.\nIn my opinion, I feel that these &quot;sam-puru&quot;s3 lean too close to Japanese-style.\nThis outfit is not meant to be an outfit for the Taki in AKATSUKI, but an exclusive outfit for &quot;Taki Ibuki&quot;.\n\n\n...? What difference does it make~? Like, it should be more of somethin’ like I’d wanna wear?\n\nAn outfit that pursues &quot;true Japanese-style&quot;… It&#39;s good there are strong feelings being put into it, but…\nThat also gives the possibility of the outfit wearin’ you rather than the other way ‘round. It’s a difficult balance, y’know? I hope it ends up bein&#39; an outfit Takis happy with.\n\nHonestly, I imagine there will need to be adjustments, given Taki himself feels it&#39;s missing something.\n\nHowever, this is all a matter of personal intuition, so there is nothing further for me to say…\nThis is a matter for Anzu-dono and Taki, after all. They&#39;ll have to discuss it until they can come to something they&#39;re both satisfied with.\n\nIt&#39;s as Kanzaki said. &quot;What&#39;s missing in the exclusive outfit?&quot; &quot;What does Taki want from it?&quot; ... There are times the answer becomes clear through talking things through.\n\nIs that so? ... You wanna learn more about me too, Anzu-neenee?\nMn~nn. You say that, but what can I even talk to you about that would help you get to know me better~?\n.. Ah!\nI just came up with a great idea~!\n\n\n    The next day. Okinawa, the main street near the airport.\n\n\nMn~ We&#39;re finally here~ Ahh, nothin’ beats the air of home sweet home~♪\n\nHm? What&#39;s the matter, Anzu-neenee?\n&quot;If we were going to Okinawa, I&#39;d have liked you to say that from the start&quot;?\n\nNyahaha. I did just tell you to meet up with me at the airport. So~rry~?\n\nBut, even though we took a plane and all, it’s not like we need much to come, right?\nIf we need anything, you can just get it here~ Even at the worst, you’ll be all good as long as you got a wallet~\n\nEither way, at the airport you weren&#39;t very surprised when I told you we were going to Okinawa, were you, Anzu-neenee?\nYou brought your stuff in a rolling suitcase, so had you known I was gonna bring you there?\n\n... I&#39;m guessing you sorta figured the moment I asked you to come to the airport. You’re amazing as always, huh, Anzu-neenee~♪\nIf you wanted to get to know me, it would’ve made more sense if we went to Okinawa to continue the conversation, rather than stay on the mainland~\n\nAlrighty. There&#39;s no time to waste, let’s head on over to Jii-chan’s place~\nGo ahead and discover all that Okinawa has to offer to your heart’s content, the place where I was born~♪\n\nChapter 2\n\nIf you go right up the road here, you&#39;ll be at Jii-chan&#39;s place before you know it~♪\nThis is the first time you&#39;re meeting Jii-chan4, right Anzu-neenee?\n\nYou heard from Hasumi-san about the kind of person he is? Reallyyy? Now I&#39;m kinda curious about what you guys talked about~?\n\n... Anzu-neenee. You&#39;ve been staring out at the sea the whole time for a while now~?\nThe sea’s beautiful in Okinawa, isn’t it? Not like on the mainland. Though to us, it’s nothing special.\nThat&#39;s not it? Then why were you staring at the ocean~?\n\nOhh, you were interested in the tourists that were snorkeling, huh~\nHow do I know they&#39;re tourists, you ask?\n\nI can tell just by looking at ‘em, you know~? People from the mainland tend to have misconceptions, but Uchinaanchu5 don’t really go into the ocean much~\n\nWell, I used to dive under the water to catch fish a lot, though. Ah, those were good times~♪\n\nI&#39;ve been fishing tons and tons since I got to the mainland, but nowadays there&#39;s all sorts of strict rules everywhere, I can’t stand it~\n\nWell, it’s not like seeing the ocean makes me want to dive or anything. You gotta do as the locals do when you’re not at home, yeah~?\nSince you&#39;ve been staring out there, are you interested in snorkeling too, Anzu-neenee?\n\nIf you are, please leave it to me~! I’m pretty sure there’s a shop I know around here~\nPre~tty sure it was this way~? Look, let's go right away~!\n\n    Fade to black\n\n\nMhmhm. Perfect. It suits you good~\nThe sea here is real beautiful, after all~ You can see clear to the bottom, right~?\n\nWhat&#39;s with the long face~ Did you not wanna go snorkeling after all?\nYou were just staring out at the sea... ? Huh, so that&#39;s what it is. I totally thought you wanted to dive right in or something~\n... Hm? But since we&#39;re here anyways, maybe if you dip into the ocean, you might be able to learn a little more about me?\n\nNyahaha, you&#39;re so constructive~ I really like that about you, Anzu-neenee~♪\nDo I need to change my clothes? Nankuru nai sa~6\n\nFirst, try swimming slowly~ Once you get used to it, try dipping your face into the surface of the water... Yeah, like that; try looking down into the sea~\nYou can see tons of fish, can&#39;t you~ You wouldn’t be able to see this clearly back on the mainland, right?\nBehind here... It should be around here, or maybe it&#39;s over here~? Hup—\n...\n\nPwah. Nyahaha, I was right on the money~♪\nOver here, Anzu-neenee, over here! You can see something interesting~!\nWe'll go under on three, 'kay~? ... One, two~ three!\n\n(一 Yup. This is the perfect spot, yeah~?)\n(It&#39;s a huge coral reef~ I used to come here all the time back when I was little~)\n(The coral&#39;s got all kinds of incredible shapes, it never gets old looking at them~♪)\n(Ah, some fish are coming up close, huh~ Nyahaha, are you guys coming to give me a welcome back party?)\n(Anzu-neenee is... Looks like she&#39;s pretty captivated by the Okinawan sea, huh~?)\n(Her eyes are sparkling~)\n\n\nPwah. ... So, Anzu-neenee? Have you taken a liking to the seas of Okinawa?\n\nNyahaha. You're awfully excited~♪ If it made you that happy, it was well worth bringing you along~\n\nI&#39;ve been swimming in the ocean ever since I was a kid, after all~ It feels really nice to have you say that about a place that&#39;s near and dear to my heart.\n\n... I was pretty naughty back then. I used to get tons of good scoldings from Jii-chan too.\nWhenever I got sick of being at Jii-chan&#39;s place, I&#39;d always just dive right into nature~\nEspecially the ocean. I didn&#39;t go swimming, really, but I&#39;d take a walk on the beach a lot~\nIt felt like this huge ocean was the one place that would accept me, an uncontrollable force tied down by society.\n\nThe ocean is freedom, after all~ A place with an open-mind, I love it~♪\n\n— Oops, I was totally going on about the past before I knew it~ Just like an old guy, yuck~ You&#39;re probably bored to death listening to me too, Anzu-neenee.\n\nThat&#39;s not true?\n\nWhat kind of places have I been? What did I see there? What made me want to cross the ocean, and become an idol?\nSo you wanna know those kinds of things, Anzu-neenee~?\nYou think that you can make an exclusive outfit more suited to me if you learn about the journey &quot;Taki Ibuki&quot; has taken, huh…\nNyahaha. You look awful serious~ Y&#39;know, I love when you make that kinda face too, Anzu-neenee~♪\n\nHuh? You were able to come up with an idea for the exclusive outfit after hearing that story?\nYou&#39;re going to add a southern island-y component to my outfit? Because there’s more to me than just “Japanese-style”?\n\n... No, it&#39;s not a bad idea or anything~ I don&#39;t know anything about outfits, but if you feel that way, I trust you~\nBut if that’s how it is, Okinawa&#39;s not the only thing to be known about me~?\nIf you wanna go down the journey of &quot;Taki Ibuki&quot;, you&#39;ll need to hear about my time growing up in America.\n\nNyahaha ♪ You're pretty interested now, huh~? ... It's a little embarrassing, but it doesn't feel so bad~\n\nFrom here on out, I&#39;m gonna show you all there is to know and more about the guy called &quot;Taki Ibuki&quot;, so get ready, kay, Anzu-neenee~♪\n\nTranslation Notes\nYou’ll often hear that Uchinaanchu don’t really swim at the beach, and they swim in their clothes when they do.

The plating’s so bright and colorful, it’s invigorating~♪\n\nAnd then…… ta-daa~aaa! With the utmost respect to all that sushi artisans do, I hold before you my sushi platter!\n\n……!?\n\nSushi! Hell yeah, we got some flame-seared ones4, some marinated5……  Bet I could stuff myself silly off this sushi alone ♪\n\nHold it. Please refrain from snacking prior to when the meal starts. Ibuki-san is the man of the hour after all.\n\n… Taki-kun? You’ve stiffened up since you saw the sushi, what’s the matter?\n\nA cut of fish laid on top6…… Th-This is sushi…??\n\nWhat about it?\n\nI know this all looks really delicious, and I know you’ve prepared so many different kinds for me, but……!\nThis sushi’s different from the kind I know~!\n\nChapter 2\n\n    A little while later\n\nSpread the rice along the seaweed and turn it over so the rice is on the mat… place the ingredients on top and then roll it all up...\nI&#39;ll place the grilled steak on the rice like this, and then on top of that, put—\n\n(Whispering) I can&#39;t wait any longer! Can’t we just eat first?!\n\n(Whispering) No can do. I’ve been made to hold back from snatching up the food too, y’know.\n\n(Whispering) Would you two hush down, please. We all decided to observe how Ibuki-san prepares sushi, didn’t we?\n\n(Whispering) I mean, meat’s getting steamed in the tin7, but is this really how sushi gets made~? Wouldn’t it make the meat a little too overpowerin’?\n\n(Whispering) It’s got a real colorful look overall too. The sushi Bukki knows seems real different from the sushi we know...\n\nWhat’re you guys whispering about? Are you that interested in the sushi I made?\n\nFor sure! ‘Cuz that right there’s American sushi, right?\n\nHuhh~, so it’s American. When I went to America for Absolute8, I didn't have any of the local sushi, so I'm kinda curious too~♪\n\nOh. Everyone was keeping their distance and watching from afar, so I thought you were all freaked out~?\nIf you think it looks tasty, eat up right away! Look, I&#39;ve arranged it all nice and pretty too!\nI’d like everyone to try the sushi that’s from the land I grew up~\n\nAhh, come to think of it... I heard that Ibuki-san was brought up in America. So you mean to say… this sushi originates from American cuisine?\n\nSome of these feel less like sushi and more like steak, though. Welp, only way to tell whether it’s sushi or meat is to try it~♪\n— On that note, thanks for the meal! (Chomp, chomp, chew, chew)...\n\nThanks for the meal. (Munch, munch)...\n\nOh...? When ya look at it, the meat’s what’s most prominent, but the juices and sauces comin’ together with the rice is makin’ it real scrumptious.\n\nAnd the way the texture and richness of the avocado brings out the entire dish like this makes it immensely delicious as well.\n\nRight~? I'm happy you’re happy~♪\n\nEven though all I did was catch a fish, you all rented out the place and made tons of food for me…\nObviously I couldn't just sit back and watch, yeah~?\n\nAnd I wanted everyone to get to know the cuisine of the country I was from, so I&#39;m glad I could treat you all to it~♪\n\n(Munch, munch)....  I just enjoy bein’ able to cook for others, that’s all.. (Chomp, chomp) I don&#39;t feel like I did anything for you in the slightest, but…\nIf you say so, I&#39;m glad you made sushi for me, Shirataki-kun! (Munch munch)\n\nNiki-san. I think you should choose between talking or eating.\n\nI mean, aren&#39;t ya eatin’ too fast? Taki-kun’s gonna eat soon too, so please make sure to leave some for him~?\nHere, Taki-kun. We’ve done enough cooking already, so let&#39;s just eat together from here.\n\nYour seat’s over here, Bukki! Now, for an especially special offer! Rinne-kun’s gonna fill up your plate, just for you ☆\n\nNyahaha. I’m the one who made the sushi though, what are you talking about~?\nBut thankies! 9 I&#39;ll scarf it up with the food Shiina-san made~♪\n\n\n    Fade to black.\n\n\n... We’re already runnin’ outta the sushi Bukki made for us, huh~?\nThe food that Shiina-senpai made us got whittled down too. If it&#39;s tasty, it’ll be gone in a blink of an eye, huh~?\n\nSeriously… Even though there was just so much, where did all the food go off to?\nKiii~dding... It all went in our tummies...♪\nIf that’s the case, should I make something next? I&#39;ll be doin’ somethin’ simple though, if that&#39;s cool.\n\nEr… Everyone, aren’t you forgetting something?\n\nForgetting something…? Like what?\n\nI figured it’d be bad to leave it out at room temperature when Ibuki-san started making his sushi... so I moved it into the refrigerator.\n\nAh. Then could it be that…!\n\nYes, that’s right. We still have some of the sushi and sashimi that Niki-san prepared for us left ♪\n\nWasn’t that supposed to be the main dish?! How’d we forget that ‘til just now?\n\nGh, what have I done...! I was so invested in Shirataki&#39;s sushi I forgot about my own cooking!\nWait, if there&#39;s sashimi and sushi, that means... there&#39;s still much more left to eat, doesn’t it?! Nice, Kazehaya-kun!\n\nSo you’re sayin’ ya did somethin’ like sending Shiina-san’s sashimi and sushi back to the fridge because of me~?\nBut that just means that I wanna make it up to you with tasty food~!\nYes, I’ve brought it over. Taking another look at it, the flesh sure is glossy and beautiful, isn’t it.\n\nIt really is! It totally surprised me earlier, but it’s beautiful when you take a closer look at it, huh~♪\n\n… Yeah. It looks really, really delicious~♪ I wanna hurry up and eat it!\nGyahaha☆ That’s a lil’ brat for ya, look at that hearty appetite ♪\n\nWell, here’s a small dish, some soy sauce, and… Taki-kun, would you like wasabi?\n\nWasabi’s… waa~ay too pungent, no thanks! I’ll just enjoy the flavors of the ingredients~\nLet’s see… The meat of this one looks particularly tasty… This, this one here… And a little bit of this~ I’ll give some to Shirataki-kun and Jun-kun!\n\nHaha, a big thanks from me ♪\n\nHas everyone picked out what they like? Place your hands together and give thanks… Now then, let us say grace.\n\nThank you for the foo~ood!\n\n\nThank you for the foo~ood!\n(Munch munch)....♪\n(We caught a ginormous fish together, and when I said I wanted to bring it back, they helped me out...)\n(They even went so far as to cook for me like this and ate what I made too.

Catch anything?\n\nHm~? I caught Old Man Nice– Nassan for short~\n\nMan. How come every time I go fishing, I end up catching a person and not a fish~? I’d rather have fresh fish for a meal today than find a person.\n\nWell, as an apology for intruding on your fishing, why don’t I treat you to dinner tonight? How’s that sound?\n\nNyahaha, you get it, dontcha~, Nassan. If you’re going to take up my time, you have to make it worth my while in equal fashion, yeah~?\n\nWe’ve formed a contract, then~ I’ll give you my dinner time, Nassan~\n\nHow was 4piece?\n\nI thought, “Why’d you go and get me fired up, calling me to Japan, only to not even choose me” or something~ Want me to go on with my list of complaints?\n\nLet’s not. But that boldness of being able to say whatever you&#39;re feeling is real Nice.\n\nWell, whatever~ It’s thanks to 4piece that I had a really good encounter, so~? I’m thankful for that~\nOh? That’s certainly Nice, hm? In Japan, they call that a “once in a lifetime encounter”. It’s great to cherish that connection.\nBy the way, Taki-kun. Have you no interest in units?\n\nUnits…? Of course I’m interested~ It’s got my heart totally and thoroughly captured lately, after all~\n\nThat’s real Nice to hear. If that’s the case, how would you like to try being the leader of a unit called “Esupuri”?\nUnits are small groups, and it’s typical to affiliate yourself with one in order to perform idol activities in this country. There’s all sorts of other details, but that’s the general rule.\nAlong those lines, I happen to be arranging a new unit of young sprouts that I’ll be producing in the hopes they’ll blossom. I’ve been giving it thought, and I believe you would be suitable as its leader, you know.\n\nWhoa… You still think highly of me despite the fact you didn’t choose me for anything in 4piece, huh~\nBut I’ll have to shoot that offer down~ I&#39;m not leadership material. Besides, there’s a different unit I’m interested in, so~\n\nOh? So there’s a unit you’ve already got your eyes on?\n\nYep. The unit Hasumi-san’s in~\n\nHasumi… Ohh, Hasumi Keito-kun from AKATSUKI.\nLooks like you and him got closer during 4piece, so I guess that’s what got you interested in him.\n\nThat’s right~ Well, I’d known AKATSUKI’s songs back when I was in America, actually~\nBut spending some time with Hasumi-san and jamming out with him made me realize something real clear~ I realized it’s exactly where I wanna be.\nI’m me no matter the place, and I’m always going to be free — but with that person, I found something I wanted to do together with him.\n— I’m looking for &quot;true Japanese-style”.\nIf it’s AKATSUKI, I figured I might be able to make my dream come true~\n\n\n… Dream. Come to think of it, I didn’t ask you why you wanted to be an idol. Is that dream why?\n\nThat’s right~ Born in Okinawa, raised in America– I&#39;ve lived close and far to Japan. Meanwhile, Hasumi-san from AKATSUKI has always championed Japanese-style.\nIf I’m gonna make my dream come true together with him, then isn’t it more convenient for me to actually be together~?\n\nThat’s pretty sound logic. However, AKATSUKI has a reputation of being an extremely tight knit, prominent three-person unit, you know.\nI feel that even if they tried bringing in an outsider2 like you in like that, there will be backlash from them and those around them.\n\nNyahaha~ Of course I’m aware of that, y’know~ But what’s the point in thinking twice about it~ Besides, do you think there wasn’t any backlash when America got its independence?\nReady to cause a rebellion, ready to pick a fight, I’m the descendant of an oni that can silence even crying children.3\nEven if it means sending down a rain of blood, I&#39;ll get what I want, when I want it~♪\n\n… Looks like your mind’s made up, huh? That’s a real shame. I was looking forward to you acting as the leader of Esupuri, though.\nThose kids are awfully unstable, after all. I was hoping you’d be able to take the lead with those kids, as someone with a firm sense of self and drive.\n\nI’m not interested in taking care of children~ I’m still a kid too, after all. It’s exactly ‘cuz of that I’m completely free~\nThis is the last stretch of getting to fool around before I grow up into some boring adult, so I’m deciding where to spend it.\nGot any objections, Nassan?\n\n\nNone here. Whether you’re in Esupuri or not is nothing but a trivial matter to me.\nAll I wanted was to guide your talent to this country and let it sprout. I scouted you because I found you promising— to me, you could blossom into a nice, big, successful flower.\nYou have the freedom to decide whether you let that sprout bud or leave it to rot.\n\nWell, just watch me. I’ll show you that I’ll meet your expectations, Nassan~\n\nHeheh, now that’s Nice. You were born in Okinawa, and then moved to the US and spent your youth there.

Meanings include &quot;outsider&quot; and &quot;someone who is different&quot;.↑ This is Ibuki's catchphrase, first said in VS AUDIENCE.↑ Some necessary context: When RYUSEITAI is in Okinawa in the story Supervillain, Tetora mentions that the crime syndicate CRIMSON Productions was previously taken down by the vigilante group Oni. In Stella Maris, Mizusaba (Ibuki's sibling) mentions that his grandfather was known as the pirate Oni. In Ibuki Idol Story 2, Ibuki confirms that both he and his grandfather are known as Oni. When Nice says Ibuki has the &quot;blood of Oni&quot; (鬼の血), he's likely either referring to what he's learned from Ibuki's catchphrase or Ibuki's grandfather directly. You can read the Ibuki Roadmap for more details.↑ Some necessary context: Ibuki self-identifies as Uchinaanchu (an uchinaaguchi word to describe a person from Okinawa) in Ibuki Idol Story 1. This makes him Ryukyuan, which are the indigenous people of Okinawa (formerly known as the Ryukyu Islands). The Ryukyus were islands independent of mainland Japan until 1609, when they were invaded and turned into a vassal state. In 1879, the Ryukyus were formally annexed into Japan as the Okinawa Prefecture. This is likely what Nice means when he says Oni (Ibuki, his grandfather, his family) are &quot;said to be the indigenous people of Japan&quot;; he's saying Ibuki and his family are said to be Ryukyuans. Still, to call them an &quot;indigenous people of Japan&quot; is still misleading, given they were not formally part of mainland Japan until 1879. Read the Unpacking Shinsei AKATSUKI note for a small summary of the Ryukyus and the steps Japan took to assimilate them after 1879.↑ Ibuki uses 半端者 here. Generally, it describes someone not fit for society. Meanings are broad, and can include delinquents, misfits, and fools. In this case, I chose to translate it as &quot;outcast&quot; because it seems to be the best fit for the story."},{"title":"The Legend of KAGETSU | No Sign of the Awaited's Arrival","url":"/translation//legend_of_kagetsu/no_sign_of_the_awaited/","content":"\n\n\n \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                                                         \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Proofreader\n                \n                \n                    Anonymous\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Season\n                \n                \n                    Spring\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nNo Sign of the Awaited's Arrival 1\n\nContent Warning: Mentions of self-harm\n\n\n    After the results announcement for 4piece. Late-May. RhyLin Office Boardroom.\n\n… Hm. I need to put in an order for the costumes for the live show soon.\nJust when I thought I had my head on straight now that 4piece is finally over. I’ve truly got no time to take a breather.\nH~mm… Should Kiryu make them or should I outsource the work…?\nNo. I really should have it outsourced this time.\nKiryu might protest, but… I need him to concentrate on the performance far more than the costumes this time.\nThis live will be different from all the ones we’ve done before for AKATSUKI, in terms of what we do. We should set plenty of time aside for practice.\n… Hm? I’m getting a call from Kiryu?\nGetting a phone call from Kiryu just as I’m talking about him... Isn’t the timing just a little too good?\nThere’s no way he heard me talking to myself from somewhere, right?\nNo, of course I&#39;m overthinking it. He&#39;s not the type of guy to resort to those kinds of underhanded means. It just happens to be good timing.\n— Hello. Kiryu, what is it?\n\n“H– Hasumi! Get to the training room right away!”\n\n– Eh? What? What’s got you that frazzled? Did something happen?\n\n“It’s nothin’ I can explain right now! Just get here– hurry!”\n\nSurely, you can come up with a quick explanation. Besides, it’s not like I have much free time either. I was just finishing up work for AKATSUKI’s—\n\n“You’d better put it off, whatever it is! Hurry the hell up, you hear me!? Now!!”\n\n…\n... He said what he wanted to say and hung up. How incorrigible.\nThat Kiryu, what the hell is he on about, with no explanation.\nBut Kiryu being that frazzled is pretty unusual for him. I guess I can’t just leave things as they are after all.\n… Can’t be helped. I’ll go and see what’s going on, as he asked.\n\n\n    Location: Training Room.\n\n\nI’m here, Kiryu.

Don’t make it worse with such a stupid fuckin’ misunderstanding, come stop Kanzaki with me!\n\nStop him? Why–?\n\n… Shit. I leave an openin’ for one second, and this guy slipped right outta my hold. He’s as tricky of an opponent as ever!?\n\nWhat on earth is happening? I can’t get a read on anything that’s going on…\n\nHasumi-dono. Please, I would like for you to hear me out.\n\n\nWhy are you speaking so formally to me, Kanzaki? When you take such a strong stance against me, it puts me on guard for some reason.\n\nThey say that in a human’s stomach lies one’s love and soul.\n\nHah…?\n\nThat is precisely why. To demonstrate my devotion and integrity, I will put my insides on full display with this seppuku!1 Please watch closely, Hasumi-dono, this is my resolve!\n\nS– Seppuku!? Stop it, you moron!?\n\nI keep telling you to fuckin’ stop, Kanza~ki~!\n(Panting laboriously)\n\nWell? What’d I say? I told you to get here right away to stop Kanzaki’s seppuku.\n\nIn no way did you say that in the slightest! You should’ve said things turned out like this before anything else! How incorrigible!\nYou too, Kanzaki! Don’t try to solve everything with a blade! I thought you’d settled down with that lately!\n\nI don’t wish to die in vain either!\nBut I wanted to raise my objections to Hasumi-dono, even if it meant in this way…!\nWhy do we need to let Taki into the AKATSUKI  “raibu”2 as a “ge-suto”!? Are you dissatisfied with just us, Hasumi-dono!?\n\nNo, that’s not the case at all. There’s nothing about you guys I’m dissatisfied with.\n\nThen why!?\n\nInviting people to guest in live shows was typical back when we were in Yumenosaki, wasn’t it?\nWe’ve even stood on stage with Mikejima before, haven’t we?3 Isn’t it the same as that?\nSo why do you hate this instance in particular so much?\n\nThis and that are completely different circumstances. In Yumenosaki, they were all treated as temporary units... And so, the song we performed was for that purpose specifically, no?\nBut this time, we will be presenting a new AKATSUKI song. That being the case, I do not want to invite a “ge-suto”, I want for us to go out and perform it— just us!\n\n…\n\nI’ve thought it over again and again— “This is a proposal of Hasumi-dono’s”… “This is his desire”.\nAnd if that is truly the case, I don’t want to raise my objections. I want to give my go-ahead without hesitation…\n— But, my heart just cannot go along with it…!\n\n\nThe day before yesterday, Hasumi came to us to talk about wantin’ to invite Taki to be a guest for the next AKATSUKI live, right? Since then, Kanzaki’s been like this the whole time.\nI don’t feel as strongly about it as Kanzaki, but I’m not so convinced either. Or maybe I should say I just can&#39;t shake this feeling that it’s all happening so late. After all, up ‘til now, live shows have been goin’ smooth for the three of us.\nI’d get it if we were dead in the water and you felt we needed to drum up some publicity, but AKATSUKI’s been on the rise lately.\nThat bein’ the case, things are fine the way they are, aren’t they?\n\nI want to hear your reasoning so that we can at least agree with you. That’s precisely why I wish to hear what your heart says, Hasumi-dono…!\n\n…\n\n… You won’t give us an answer?\n\nNo, it’s not that…\nSorry. I haven’t been able to think it through enough to explain it well enough. I don’t know how to put it into words for you guys.\nBut… There’s something I want to try, no matter what it takes… This is definitely an act of my own selfishness. You guys just got swallowed into it.\n\nI don’t believe Hasumi-dono is acting thoughtlessly. If anything, I know without a doubt there is some thought behind it.\nIn all honesty, I couldn’t care less about Taki…\nPlease understand, Hasumi-dono. What matters to me most is AKATSUKI, where you and Kiryu-dono are. I want you to see where my feelings of disdain are coming from…!\n\n…\n\nBut… If it’s Hasumi-dono’s wish to have Taki join us in a “raibu”, I certainly intend to grant it.\nTherefore, here is my one proposition.\nTo see if Taki is worthy of joining AKATSUKI onstage as a “ge-suto”— I would like to make him take an entrance exam.\nThe same hyper-difficult entrance exam I failed many times over when we were in Yumenosaki.4\n\n… Hah?\nHold it, Kanzaki. You know there’s no way I can accept that.\n\nNo. Accept my wish, no matter the cost. I figured this would be the best way to break the stalemate between us.\n\nOi, oi. What kinda weird direction did this conversation take?\nWhat should we do, Hasumi? That entrance exam’s a little…\n\nYeah. All that exam was for was to reject anyone who wanted to join AKATSUKI. I’m pretty sure Kanzaki doesn’t know about that, though.\n\nWhat are you two talking about? I would like for you to listen to what I have to say diligently. I am being serious.\nThis decision is not for Taki’s sake. This is for the sake of nestling close to your feelings, Hasumi-dono— to come to an agreement, consider this a duel between Taki and I…!\n\nThis is turning out to be more trouble than I thought, huh...\n\nNo Sign of the Awaited's Arrival 2\n\n    Several days later, the day of the AKATSUKI Guest Exam. The Examination Hall: the dance room.\n\n\n— He’s late!\n\n— He’s late!\n\nThat Taki was a complete no-show. It’s already five minutes before we start!\nMeanwhile, we AKATSUKI have all arrived fifteen minutes earlier than the appointed time already!\nHasumi-dono, what on earth is happening? Today is the day of the exam, is it not?\n\nYou’re not mistaken. I haven’t heard anything from Taki either. Rather, I’d better be hearing from Taki by now about what on earth he’s doing.\n\nStill, if he’s this late, maybe somethin’ came up…?\n\nEven so, he should’ve gotten in touch and sent a message. Does Taki not know the expression “spin it by me and keep me posted”?5\n\n\nHow rude, Hasumi-san~ I know I grew up in America, but I do know what spinach is y’know~\nI’ll have you know I’ve had some before— Creamed spinach, stuff like that~ Keep underestimating me and my lawyers’ll be hearing about it, ‘kay~?\n\nTaki…! Where on earth have you been? You’re late!\n\nLate?\nNyahaha. What’re you talking about~ I came at the time you told me to~ Didja forget what you guys sent me~?\nLook, here. This is the time in the message Hasumi-san sent me. See~?\n\n…\n\nWell… He’s definitely not late for the time that’s written…\n\nTaki… In Japan, there’s a general idea of “acting five minutes early”. It’s considered etiquette to arrive five to ten minutes earlier than the designated time.\n\nEtiquette? Coming earlier than the designated time, even if it isn’t written?\nI don’t get it~ If that’s the case, it makes way more sense to just say you wanna push the time forward~ Right~?\nBesides, if you make a formal mention of it but leave the rest to the discretion of the person, that’s not something I’d say you should abide by to begin with~\nThat’s unthinkable in America, a contract-based society~ Contracts are supposed to prevent disputes after all~ It’d go to trial straight away~\n\n…!? (Frozen that something he doesn’t comprehend is unfolding before him)\n\nI’ve gotten a headache already.\nWell, let’s drop it. I don’t have anything to say as of now. We were the ones who asked you to go out of your way for this exam in the first place.\nAnyways, we should start the test— Hm? Taki. Didn’t I tell you to come with your practice clothes? Why are you in your normal clothes?\n\nHm? Oh yeah. That’s why I’m going to get changed now~\n\n… Taki. In these situations, you should have changed your clothes before the designated time.\n\nIs that etiquette too?\n\nThat’s right.\n\nHmm. You guys really mind all the little details, huh~ You’re gonna go bald if you worry about all those trivialities, y’know~?\n\nThey’re not trivial!\n\nNow, now. There’s no point in rushing, after all. “Haste makes waste”6 as they say~ Well, I’ll go change~\n\n(Sigh)... That guy hasn’t changed at all since 4piece, huh…\n\n… Hey, Hasumi. Is this really okay?\nI didn’t come from an upbringing that lets me lecture people on common sense, so I don’t really wanna chime in here, but…\nTaki&#39;s disposition’s a lil’ too unsuitable for AKATSUKI, isn’t it? It’s not gonna be breathable for someone like Taki either.\nBesides, look. Kanzaki’s been frozen like a statue for quite a while now, hand on his sword, meetin’ a guy he can’t comprehend…\n\n\n.....!? ......!?\n\nO~i. Kanzaki, you good?\n\n— Hah!\nI nearly got thrown off completely by that guy. Taki… What cowardly tricks–!\nI will not be broken…!!\n\n\n    Fade to black.\n\nNow, let’s get to the exam– I’m looking forward to it~\n\n… Ahem. This Kanzaki Souma will be the one administering your7 exam. Everything I have prepared for you will be no easy feat.\nBut in order to take your place on “su-teeji” alongside AKATSUKI, you should be able to figure out this much.\nProceed with caution. There will be a written exam to start with. Try to solve the problem written on this sheet.\n\nWell, I’ll do the best I can~ Studying’s never been my strong suit, though.\n… Leeet’s see here? “Suppose there are a large number of points on a plane, but no three points rest on a straight line.”\n“Here, if you can connect N vertices smoothly, you will always be able to create a convex N-sided polygon.”\n“Now then. How many points are enough to do so?” …? What the heck~ What’s with this question?\n\nI don’t even get the point of the question.\n\nThis is called the “Happy End” problem8, a universally difficult question…♪ Now, go on. Try and answer this fine question…♪\n\nHold it right there, Kanzaki. No one has solved this question yet, it’s one of the most difficult problems in the world.\n… I take it that you have no intention of passing Taki, hm?\n\nTh– That’s not it. Even as a “ge-suto”, these are barriers to represent how challenging it is to stand on the same “su-teeji” as AKATSUKI.\nBesides, I’ll see if he has the strength to face difficult problems without losing heart.\n\nMm~mm… Well, I’ll go with “100 Trillion”.\n\nWhat!? You little–! I won’t let you give me some random answer just because you don’t know the real one!\n\nHm? Why not~? If I get 0 points for not answering, at least I have a chance at getting it right if I do answer. Right~? You’ll lose out if you don’t answer something at least~\n\nThat’s what I figured anyway. I don’t know the answer, so I just guessed “100 Trillion”~\nWell, Kanzaki-san? What’s the answer~?\n\n… That’s… Mnmnm…\n\nLooks like Kanzaki’s stumped.\n\nI bet he is. Even if you wanted the correct answer, it hasn’t been solved yet after all.\n\n… I don’t know the answer myself, so I suppose posing this question was a little childish. I’ve decided to declare this question a stalemate.\nBut the second question won’t be like the first!\n\nNyahaha. Bring it on~♪\n\n\nThis is startin’ to look more and more like a kiddy fight. Hey, Hasumi. Are you gonna let things keep up like this?\n\nGood grief… How incorrigible. I’d like for this nonsense to stop as much as you do, but…\nI can’t stop it: I’m hearing Kanzaki out from the depth of his heart. If it makes him feel more at peace, I’ll let him do as he likes.\n\nNo Sign of the Awaited's Arrival 3\n\nNext is a test that assesses your physical strength.\nIt’s an absolute necessity to have in order to stand on “su-teeji” for long periods of time and be an “aidoru”.\n\nSo in other words, it’s a physical one, huh~? Ok. That’s way, way easier to do than using my head.\n\nYes, that spirit is good. Well then, first, I’ll demonstrate.\nHh–up! One, two… three…\n\nWhoa~ Look at you go~ Kanzaki-san!\n\nWhoa…! Kanzaki’s incredible. He started doing handstand push-ups.\n\nIt’s ‘cuz his physical abilities are so damn high. His core’s good too, what with all the daily trainin’ he’s built up with swordsmanship ‘n iaido.9\n\n– Phew. Like this, alright? How about it, Taki. Can you pull off a feat like this?\n\nMn~ I’ve definitely never done that before, but… Well, whatever, I’ll manage it one way or another~\nFirst, I do the handstand…! Hup. And then I start doing pushups, right~?\nO~ne, two…\n\nWh– Wh-Wh— Whaaat!? He managed it so easily!?\n\nNyahaha. It’s nothin’, really~ I’ve got a real natural thing for physical activity, so this much is a piece of cake~ Si~x, se~ven…\n\nIf you want, I can do it like this~ … Hup ♪ Ei~ght, ni~ne, te~n…\n\nWhat the!? He switched to do his handstands on just one finger!?\nThat’s incredible. I’d always known he had physical ability even back during 4piece, but… I never thought he’d be this physically capable.\n\nOi, oi. It’s not even a matter of having high physical ability or somethin’ anymore. This would make street performers go pale in the face.\n\nHngngh… Taki, that’s enough for the second test.\n\nHm? Already~? I can still do way more, though.\n\nIt’s frustrating, but I see well enough how high your physical ability is. It’s worthy of humble praise. So that’s enough.\n— But the next test will not be like this!\nIt has become time for the final test. And therefore, this question is the ace I’ve tucked away in my sleeve. This is my secret weapon…!\n\nOhh, it’s finally time for the last test~? I’m looking forward to it~♪\n\n    Fade to black\n\n\nNow, Kanzaki-san. What’s next~? I’m not gonna run away or hide~, ‘kay~?\nC’mon now, I don’t think you’re the kinda guy who’d run away after comin’ this far.\n\nNyahaha. Saying stuff like that gets my momentum going~ Having that kinda back-and-forth to challenge me gets me motivated~\n\nHaha. Keepin’ that calm under these conditions. What a guy you are, huh?\n\nTaki, could you stay focused? If you’re too relaxed, everything will slip from your fingers.\nNow then, it is time to announce the final test. The final test is — this!\n\nHm~? Kanzaki-san’s holding a picture? With a shiisaa10 drawn on it~?\n“Shii-saa”...? No, this is a lion?11\n\nKanzaki. Neither term is wrong. In Okinawa, they call lions “shiisaa”.\n\nHmm. I see. If that’s the case, as Taki says, there is a “shii-saa” drawn on this hanging scroll.\n\nIt’s definitely a shiisaa, but it has a completely different feel from an Okinawan shiisaa~?\nThe color, maybe~? Or maybe its shape~? I dunno what’s giving it that sorta feel, but…\n\n— Yeah, I really do want this~\n\nThis hanging scroll is an item of my family’s, with great honorable origin. I have no intention of selling it to you, no matter how lofty the price.\n\nNyahaha. I didn’t mean it like that~, Kanzaki-san.\nWell, it’s fine for now~ More importantly, it’s time for the final test, right~?\n\nHm? That’s right. Let us proceed.\nFor the final test, you must try capturing the lion painted on this hanging scroll! This is the question to end all questions… Will you be able to solve it?\n\nThis is just Ikkyu-san…!?12\n\nAnd there’s not even a twist to it.\nEven I know the answer. What the hell is Kanzaki thinking askin’ a question like this?\n\nI have to catch the lion? That seems like it’s gonna be a real big pain to do~?\n\nHm? Taki doesn’t know the famous line that goes with this?\n\nAhh. Taki may have been born in Okinawa, but he’s spent most of his life in America, as I understand it.\nIf you grew up in America, of course you wouldn’t know what Ikkyu-san is.\n\nThen yeah, guess that definitely makes it a tough question.\n\nMm~mn…\n\n(It is said that “if you know your enemy and you know yourself, you shall not fear a hundred battles”.13 For this exam, I looked more into Taki!)\n(That being the case, as Taki’s been overseas for so long, I’m sure he can’t figure out the line that goes with this question…!)\nNow, try and capture it, Taki!\n\n— Alright! Got it!\nAmerica doesn’t have lions, but I did fight grizzlies there, so~! It’ll probably be fine~\nHah? “Gurizz-uri”...?\n\nI’m ready to strike~! Now, Kanzaki-san. Bring out the lion from the picture, ‘kay~?\nWh– WhaaAAAAT…!?\n\n? Well, I have to catch it, don’t I? If you don’t get it out of the picture, even someone like me can’t catch it~\nIf you could just get the lion out for me, I think I could hold my own against it~♪\n\n\n…\n\nWhat a guy... Taki wasn&#39;t worryin’ about thinking up a witty answer. He was thinkin’ over whether or not he could win against the lion, huh.\n\nHe’s too muscle-brained… Unbelievable. He’s such a natural airhead, he managed to give the same response as Ikkyu-san.\n\nI&#39;m startin’ to feel a lil’ bad for Kanzaki. Look at him, his shoulders are all slumped..\n\n… I’ve been completely and utterly defeated.\n\nHm? What’s that supposed to mean~?\n\nIt means you passed the exam, Taki.\n\nHuh…? What the heck gave me the pass?\n\n\n    The next day, after Ibuki’s Guest Entrance Exam finished. In the Vocal Room.\n\n\n♪~♪~ Haisa~i☆14\nHm? Ohh, Taki. It seems you’ve been coming exactly ten minutes early now. And you’ve already changed into your practice clothes.\n\nI still don&#39;t get why I hafta come early, y’know~ It doesn’t make any logical sense.\nBut, this is good for you guys, right~? So I took it seriously and learned, y’know~\nLogical sense is unrelated to the matter of etiquette. Etiquette is the “heart”, or compassion, of forming the “shape” of “manners”. In other words, it stands for the “shape of compassion” — as in, expressing your compassion in a tangible way.15\n\nHmmn. The shape of compassion…\n\nI’m sure you’ll come to understand the importance of that sort of etiquette soon enough.\n\nSo, Hasumi-no-danna. You said we’re startin’ practices from today onward, but is the new song for the live show ready?\n\nYes, here. Please look over the song lyrics, everyone.\n\n“Ten”…? I’ve studied basic kanji, but I’m still not used to complicated kanji with loads of strokes~ Hasumi-san, how do you read this one~?\n\nThe song’s called “Tenshou Kagetsu”.16\n\n“Ten-shou Ka-ge-tsu”…17\nIt’s got a nice ring to it~ It feels real Japanese to the core.\nHasumi-san. Y’know~, I’ve been wanting to see what “true Japanese-style”’s18 all about~ That’s my dream.\nYou’ve been wanting to see what “true Japanese-style” is…? What do you mean by that?\n\nNyahaha. I’m having trouble understanding that too~ I’ve been looking for the answer the whole time.\nWell, don’t mind me~\nI think it’s nice, y’know. “Tenshou Kagetsu”~ It’s so fitting for AKATSUKI~ This sorta vibe is pretty neat~\n\n…\nYou feel that it’s fitting for AKATSUKI?\n\nEh? Yeah. That’s what I think, at least. You don’t like it, Hasumi-san?\n\n… No. It’s not that. I do think that the song turned out great.\n\n\n…?\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Souma's running gag is regularly resorting to performing seppuku to make up for trouble. 切腹 (seppuku or harakiri, lit. belly-cutting ) was a form of ritualistic suicide samurai used for a variety of reasons. For Souma, that tends to be shame. However, in this context, it is an act that asks for a true, heartfelt plea to be heard; the stomach was where one's soul and love was believed to be held.↑ In Japanese, words from other languages (such as English) are typically rendered in katakana.

That felt nice just now. There weren’t any mistakes from anyone~\n\nRight? Let’s do it one more time while it’s still in our muscle memory.. Ahh, but it might be better if we break off by ourselves to practice...?\nOi, Danna. What should we do? Start from the top and go to the end one more time? Or should we just focus on the areas we’re not solid on yet?\n\n…\n\nOi, ya listenin’? Hasumi?\n\n– Huh? Ahh, yeah. What is it? Did you want something?\n\nSo you weren’t listenin’ to what we said.\n\nSorry, I spaced out a little.\nKiryu, what should we do? Start from the top and go to the end? Or split off and focus on the parts we’re having trouble with…?\n\nThat’s what I just asked ya, though. What on earth is goin’ on with you? All you’ve been doin’ lately is spacin’ off more and more as the days go on.\n\n… No, sorry. I might just be tired from all the practice we’ve been doing every day. I’ll be more careful and try not to lose focus.\n\nThat’s not what I’m tryna say...\n\nAnyways. Each of you, check the tricky parts one more time. In five minutes, we’ll come back together and do the whole thing one more time, start-to-finish.\n\nKiryu-dono.\n\n\nOh, what is it, Kanzaki?\n\nWhat on earth is going on with Hasumi-dono? It’s as if he&#39;s there in body but not in spirit… It seems like something’s weighing on his mind…\n\nSo he looks that way to you too huh. Looks like I&#39;m not just makin’ somethin’ out of nothin’ about it all, then.\n\n… Besides, it’s not just Hasumi-dono who is acting weird.\n\nWho else besides him?\n\nThat Taki. I mean, he has been acting more strange by the day as well. It seems like he’s been keeping his spirit and intensity bottled up.\n\nThat right? He doesn’t seem any less lively than usual just by looking at him, though.\n\nNo. He’s as lively as ever. I was worried that with the addition of Taki, we would get out of time with each other, lose step and lose precision, but…\nIt doesn’t look to be that way: we seem to be synchronizing just fine.\nIt isn’t like it was when we first started practices, where we were trying to wrangle a vagabond… it was like trying to catch the wind. Right now, it feels like there’s no sense of challenge—\n…\n… (Cough). I don’t mind if he&#39;s easier to deal with, though.\n\nI see, huh. I wouldn’t say he’s quieter than usual, but maybe a lil’ more subdued?\n\nWell, yes, put simply.\n\nIt feels a lil’ creepy. Lotsa things are going right, but there’s this weird disconnect everywhere.\nMaybe I’d better give him a little prod, huh…?\n\n\n    Fade to Keito's temple.\n\n\n… [Sitting in zazen]\n(The phrase “taming the mind” truly does exist for a reason. I wanted to clear my head, so I came home for the first time in a while, and it seems like that was the right call.)\n(It felt like all of my thoughts were in tangles. I feel much more calm now.)\n(Although, just because I’ve composed myself doesn’t mean I’m not lost anymore.)\n(It’s like I’ve been trapped in a bottomless swamp, unable to move.)\n(I decided to bring Taki in as a guest on stage and everything is moving forward, but… is letting things stay as they are really okay...?)\n(Taki isn’t the problem. If anything, I think he’s doing a great job.)\n(Kanzaki and Kiryu too. They may have mixed feelings, but they haven’t let it show. They’ve really thrown themselves into rehearsal..)\n(Thanks to that, I imagine the next performance will be a good one.)\n( — A good live, fit for AKATSUKI.)\n(So why on earth does it leave a bad taste in my mouth?)\n\n\n(... No. I know the reason for it. I’m just pretending not to notice it.)\n(I’m just not confident in my decision, that’s what it is. I&#39;m afraid to admit that the choice I made might have been a mistake.)\n(In other words… Was inviting Taki to be a guest with AKATSUKI truly the right call…?)\n…\n(But, that moment… Without a doubt, I felt like I saw a glimpse of light.)\n(I don’t care if it’s just a hallucination or my own wild assumption. The feeling I felt then was real.)\n(When I stood with Taki on the stage of 4piece—)\n\nNo Sign of the Awaited's Arrival 5\n\n… Hold it, Taki!1\n\n『♪ ! ♪! ♪!』\nLook, look! That’s a shamisen over there, right? Jam sesh with me~♪\n\nYou…! Have you no consideration for where I stand…!\nFine. I’ll just play the shamisen, then…!\n『♪~♪~♪!』\n(No, no. That’s no good~ Hasumi-san.)\n\n(... Hm? That Taki guy’s signalling something at me with his eyes… What is it?)\n\n(This is a chance we can’t miss~, right~?)\n\n(Think about it carefully~ We&#39;re the only ones here on stage. We&#39;re playing our favorite AKATSUKI song. People who love music are right in front of us.)\n(Idols and examinations don&#39;t matter here~ There are musical performances that can show someone a good time, one that can be enjoyed with all your entirety even more. But right now, all we’re doing is playing the guitar and shamisen~)\n(If it’s you, Hasumi-san, you’d get me~, right~? What we should do?)\n(... Damn it. That’s what he meant.)\n(Very well then, we’ve gone too far to go back. If this is how it is, I might as well be on board until the end…!)\n『 ♪ ! ♪ ! ♪ !』\nYou meant like this, right, Taki!\n\nYeah, yeah! It’s gonna get more and more fun from here~ Keep up~ ‘kay~?\n\n…–!\n(He upped the tempo even more…!)\n(Yet as soon as he did, it became a smooth, clear stream, before dropping down like a violent waterfall.)2\n\n『♪~♪~...♪! ♪!』\n『♪~♪~...♪! ♪!』\n\n(Engulfed by the raging, rushing river of the sound.)\n(What on earth is this… I see light surrounding us.)\n( – This is fun.)\nHa, hahaha…\n\n\nNyahaha. That’s a real nice smile~, Hasumi-san. Fun, right~? It’s fun for me too~ This stage is so fun~ It’d be a waste to have such a grumpy look on your face, y’know~\nWell, if you held back from acting off your impulses, I’d say the likelihood of a grumpy look on my face drops by 30%.\n\nYou got me there~ Nyahahaha☆\n\n(... Hmph. Taki’s proclivity to do things as he pleases is unmanageable.)\n(He just starts appealing without thinking… Doesn’t he get that there’s “music enthusiasts” of all kinds out there?)\n(Still… This is the first time I’ve heard “A Thousand Blossoms, the Night of Crimson Moon” sound like this.)\n(The AKATSUKI song catches onto Taki’s wind and soars into the sky… what is this…?)\n\n『─♪!』\n\n『─♪!』\n\n… (Panting). Eh? Over already~...?\nAh~ I wanna perform for a whole other hour~! Hey~? Don’t you feel that way too, Hasumi-san?\n…\n\nHm? What’s the matter~? You’re staring at your hand. Don’t tell me you got hurt?\n\n… No, that’s not it.\n(My hand’s shaking… From excitement.)\nTaki. I…\n\nHasumi-san?\n\n\n    Fade back to the temple. The sound of a punch.\n\n\n— Hasumi!\n\nUwahh!? What the—?\nI’m not that sturdy, so don’t hit me like a temple bell…!\n\nThose are some real powers of concentration, huh. That’s a son of the temple for ya, flawless Zen ‘n selflessness, huh. You didn’t respond no matter how many times I called out to ya, I even thought you were sleepin’ for a second there.\n\nWhy are you here, Kiryu…?\n\nWhen I went by your dorm, they told me you went back home. I came after you.\n\nI just wanted to sit zazen— No, hold it. Why did you stop by for me at the dorm?\n\nIs that what you’re really gonna say…?\nThings have gotten real weird lately. I mean, you&#39;ve been completely spaced out the whole time.\nIt’s pretty much standard fare that the reason you worry yourself to death like that is something to do with AKATSUKI.\nI dunno if you’re troubled about somethin’ or fightin’ with somethin’, but Kanzaki and I’ve picked up on it, whatever it is.\n\n…\n… You guys saw through me?\nThat’s right… It’s about AKATSUKI. If I couldn’t hide it, I suppose that means I have to tell you properly.\nThe truth is—\n\nAh~ Hold it, Danna. I came all the way out here to get ya to talk, but sorry, if it’s about AKATSUKI, I’ll listen to ya when Kanzaki’s here with us.\nIf we do this here ‘n leave Kanzaki out of it, he’s gonna get real disgusted with us. Real disgusted.\n\n… Is that so?\nNo, you’re right. I realize how oblivious I’ve been to my surroundings…... Sorry.\n\nWell, it’s fine. Honestly, I wasn’t sure whether or not I should prod you ‘til you opened up about what’s on your mind.\nIf AKATSUKI’s the thing you’re worried about, I don’t want you to take it on all by yerself\nBut I didn’t want to force ya to tell me anythin’ you didn’t wanna tell me. I think Kanzaki feels the same.\nSo, when the time’s right and you feel like you wanna talk, come and confide in us properly.\nForget me, Kanzaki’s a real sharp guy too. It’s a lot more constructive to leave it to us than worryin’ on yer own, right?\nWell, up ‘til now, all I’ve ever done is leave everything up to you, so I guess it’s on me things got like this too.\n\nThat’s not it. This is just the way I am.\n\nThat right? What a coincidence, huh. That’s the way I am too.\nBut, I’ve decided to stop sittin’ on the fence and leavin’ everything up to you, Danna. So, hurry up and throw those worries you’ve been carryin’ all on your own onto us already.\n\n…\n(Sigh)... I’m utterly disgusted by how shallow my own thinking’s been. Honestly, how shameful.\nNo matter how many times I reflect, I keep making the same mistakes over and over... I’m not in the position to lecture others, being like this.\n\nHahaha. That’s fine. Just ‘cuz you’re an educator doesn’t mean you gotta be perfect.\nBesides, everyone goes down the same path, doin’ the same thing over ‘n over again.\nMakin’ mistakes again and again is how you get the ability to change lil’ by lil’, right? That’s how it is for me and the people around me, anyways.\nThey say a leopard can’t change its spots. Ya can’t change who ya are that much, and even if ya set yer mind on doin’ it, ya can’t get dramatic development like the hero from a manga or a movie can.\n\nYou’re right. I’ve always been aware of that, but figures, I’ll never become the protagonist of my own story.\n\nWhat’s with that? Do ya prefer the superhero stories where they can do everything from the start? Well, guess that is a pretty standard ideal for men, though.\nWell, I actually like the stories where the protagonist makes mistakes ‘n grows lil&#39; by lil&#39;, too. There’s lots of that kinda thing in delinquent manga.\n\n… I’m not a delinquent.\n\nFor sure. You’ve always been a serious honors student, Danna.\nThat’s why me ‘n Kanzaki are worried. You’re overthinkin’ more than ya should, aren’tcha?\nThat’s all I came by to say today. See ya.\n\n…\n(What am I really doing here? Making everyone worried, making them read too much into things. How shameful.)\n(— I’ll steel myself too.)\n(I don&#39;t know if I’ll be able to express myself properly, but I&#39;ll try and confront it head on. We should be close enough that I can manage to do that at the very least.)\n(Tomorrow, we have practice arranged for the live. When it’s time and everyone’s gathered, I’ll tell them all how I really, truly feel.)\nHah. It&#39;s a serious opportunity to be able to practice at the actual venue… I feel miserably bad for putting a damper on it, but…\nIt&#39;s far better than continuing to shoulder this self-centered indecision and going out into the performance with it.\n\nNo Sign of the Awaited's Arrival 6\n\n    Season: Summer\n\n\n— He’s late!\n\nThis is just like the scene from the other day.\n\n.. No good. Tried callin’ his phone, but he’s not pickin’ up at all.\n\nWhat on earth could be the matter. There’s absolutely no way he changed his mind and decided to skip out on us or something, right…?\n\nAt first I was angry and thought he was insolent, but once practice started, he seemed to be taking it seriously. I doubt he’d slack off now.\n\nOh?\n\nHuh. At first I wasn’t sure how it’d go, but I’m glad to see some trust’s been growing.\n\n… On second thought. Maybe he skipped out after all. That’s what that guy would do.\n\nHeh. You don’t need to walk it back.\nIt really is like you said, Kanzaki. It&#39;s hard to imagine that now of all times, after throwing himself wholly and entirely into practices, Taki would just vanish for no reason.\n\nSo if that’s the case, the natural conclusion is that somethin’ must&#39;ve come up that was absolutely unavoidable.\n\nWhat business could possibly take more priority over “aidoru” work…?\n\nBeats me. We’ll just have to ask Taki himself.\n\nAt the very least, let&#39;s try calling Taki one more time. We have to get a hold of him no matter what it takes.\nHonestly… With things like this, I should’ve given him a full rundown on keeping people posted3, not just the five-minutes-early rule.\n… (Calling Ibuki on his smartphone)\n… No good. Figures, he’s not picking up—\n\n“... Hello, Hasumi-san?”\n\n! Taki! Where in the world are you, what are you doing? I thought I told you that today we were practicing on the ES live stage.\nWhere are you? Can you get over here right away?\n\n“Ah~ I’m not coming~ Or maybe I should say, sorry, but I&#39;m gonna back out of all this~ So just do the next live by yourselves, ‘kay~?\n\nHah? What’s all this, all of a sudden? You were practicing so hard just a few days ago.\n\n“It’s not sudden, though~ I said I could perform a live with AKATSUKI, and I tried to do my best and match up with you guys, but~”\n“Figures, I’m an oni and an outcast at the end of the day. It’d be better if I had nothing to do with AKATSUKI~ So, you can just leave me alone~”\n\nWait, wait. Don’t just move the conversation on as you please. We have no clue what your situation is.\nBefore anything, we need to talk. If you can’t come here, we’ll come to you. Where are you right now?\n\n“Nyahaha. What a pick-up line, huh~?”\n\n… Don’t joke around. I’m being very serious. I’m prepared to face it head on. We will be having you at that stage too.\n\n“I see. But too bad. I don’t think you guys are gonna be able to get where I am, y’know~?”\n\nHah…?\n\n“‘Cuz I’m in Okinawa right now.”\n\nWhat!? How the hell did that happen, Taki! You were in the dorms just yesterday, weren’t you!?&quot;\n\n“Well, that’s how it is~ Just forget about me, ‘kay~?”\n“Practicing with AKATSUKI was really, really fun~ Tell Kanzaki-san and Kiryu-san that I enjoyed working with them~ Bye bye~...♪”\n\n… He hung up.\n\nHasumi took the call on speaker, so we could hear the whole conversation with Taki, but… what the hell was that all about?\n\nI’ve lost all patience for this! After all of this, how can he just say goodbye!?\nWe’ll leave for Okinawa at once, I won’t be satisfied until I hack off that half-willed attitude myself!\n\n\nThat’s right. I won’t be satisfied with just one lecture, either.\nIf we leave from here now… Hm, hmm— Alright.\nSmartphones are always handy, huh. You can get the best solution right away. If we leave from here and get to the airport now, we catch the evening flight into Okinawa.\nLet’s go. If he’s so sure we won’t come, let’s go surprise him. He can tell us himself why he thinks nothing can be done.\n\n… Eh? Hold on a second…!?\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ This original scene is in VS AUDIENCE Hundred 11, seen from a broad perspective.↑ Wordplay on Ibuki's last name, Taki (滝, waterfall)↑ 報連相 (horenso, lit. &quot;reporting, contacting, consulting&quot;), which is about keeping your supervisor informed and aware."},{"title":"The Legend of KAGETSU | Prologue","url":"/translation//legend_of_kagetsu/prologue/","content":"\n\n\n \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n                      \n                                                      \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Proofreader\n                \n                \n                    Anonymous\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Season\n                \n                \n                    Spring\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nPrologue 1\n\n    ES’s second year of establishment, Spring. Early May. In front of RhythLin agency 1\n\n\n… Hm? There used to be a poster promoting a drama in the hallway outside the offices, but it’s been changed out for a poster of Rumbling Heaven and Earth R.2 I didn’t notice.\n(I wasn’t sure what would happen after being entrusted with Rumbling Heaven and Earth and meeting the Three Sages…)3\n(But as a result, we succeeded in making the show back into a hit again, spreading it even to an audience that wasn’t interested in history, while managing to not dismiss the wishes of the Three Sages.)\nIt must’ve become a real big hit if they made a poster like this for it… Seeing it here is pretty moving.\nHm?\nWhat the? The office is terribly noisy.\n\n\nAhh. Congratulations, Hasumi-kun.\n\nSakuma? You came in to the office too?\nActually, what’s with that greeting? It’s more appropriate to say something like “Good afternoon” or “Thank you for your hard work”. It’s too early for you to be getting senile.\n\nYou haven’t found out about the news yet?\nAKATSUKI was awarded the Diamond Arrow Rookie of the Year Award, you know.\nYou were nominated, no? Your achievements with Rumbling Heaven and Earth R seemed to be appraised on a grand scale.\nApparently, this is the first time the agency has won the Diamond Arrow Award. RhythLin has been long-established, but up until now, none of its rookies have done anything flashy enough to warrant the award.\nIt’s an incredible accomplishment for rookies, and everyone in the agency is absolutely thrilled about it.\n\n… So that’s what the noise is about.\n\nYou aren’t happy? The Diamond Arrow Award is a considerably prestigious one.\n\nNo, of course I’m glad. Kiryu and Kanzaki would be too— Especially if it’s the achievements of Rumbling Heaven and Earth R.\n\nYou say that, but it doesn’t look as if you’re glad.\nThe Hasumi-kun I know may put on a cool composure, but he also tends to wear his heart on his sleeve, surprisingly earnest and honest. He’s the kind of guy who dances flamenco when a salsa rhythm comes on.\n\nI regret to inform you that Hasumi-kun isn’t me.\n\nWhat? That’s boring. If you don’t come up with more witty comebacks to fire back at me, it’s going to get real dull, you know.\n\nGo do that kind of thing with Hibiki. If it’s him, he&#39;d blend dances from all around the world and improvise a wild, exuberant dance.\n\nBut when Hibiki-kun goes all out, it’s too miraculous. There’s no way to get an edge in, competing with him.\nAt any rate. What on earth is going on with you, truly? Is there something that’s bothering you?\n\n...\n\nIf there’s something that’s worrying you, you can always speak to me about it. We’re fellows in the same agency, after all.\nBesides, haven’t AKATSUKI’s efforts been doing quite remarkably lately? Something like that one saying, &quot;momentum that could take down birds in flight” — It makes me quite proud as a friend.\n\nDon’t give me such weird flattery. AKATSUKI’s on thin ice right now.\n\nThin ice, you say?\n\nYes. AKATSUKI’s recent efforts have certainly been on an irresistible winning streak. Thinking about the time when things were stalling out, this probably seems like absolutely remarkable efforts.\nBut, that’s a farce.\nFrom where I’m looking at it, the results we’re getting are far more overblown than our actual activities. You’ve got to be at least a little aware of this too, right, Sakuma? This trend in the agency?\n\nHmhm. So that’s what was with the long face.\nI did sense that there was some fishy behavior here and there in the agency. Well, not so much sense, as I was moreso concerned it could happen.\n\nThe agency intends to carry AKATSUKI over their shoulders like a mikoshi.4\nAKATSUKI’s activities are being reported on with grandiosity, they’re joyfully celebrating us, just about everything and anything we’re doing is being over-exaggerated, all to mark AKATSUKI as idols that are on the rise.\nI believe that’s exactly how they intend to make AKATSUKI into overnight sensations.\n\nPrologue 2\n\nThis is a guess of mine, but— our agency is long-established. As such, the only people who take the lead within it are big names in the industry. Until now, that’s probably been fine.\nThat said. I think somewhere along the way, somehow, the matter of succession came up in meetings amongst the higher-ups.\nUntil now, those people in the agency had been fine only thinking about themselves, but…\nFor the sake of keeping the agency going in the future, they’ve started to take the matter of succession into serious consideration because they have to. That’s what I suspect.\n\nOho, I see.\nRhythLin has a large amount of big names who are long-established.\nThat’s exactly why it became extremely clear to them that it’s going to be difficult to replicate other agencies’ practice of bringing in the generational cycling of new blood to replace the old in a place like RhythLin.\n\nRight. I imagine that’s why they’re moving to pick a successor so hastily like they are now.\nAnd everything that’s been happening here lately makes sense if it was AKATSUKI that was chosen out of the whole lot.\nWhy AKATSUKI, though…?\nUNDEAD and other units should be more than enough, with all due fairness. When it comes to UNDEAD, the merit and popularity is all there.\n\nWell, there is the reality that there are those within the agency who don’t accept the way we do our activities and musicianship, as well.\n\nThat’s right. There are plenty of stubborn people among the higher-ups of the agency. They aren’t open to the new trends that come with the times.\nI suppose that’s exactly why you and Hakaze were laying the groundwork from the start, huh? You were making supporters for UNDEAD so they could be your allies.\nAnd that would make it harder for your opposition to speak out against you publicly.\n\nIndeed. That’s one reason. Good things will come your way if you pluck pebbles off the path ahead of time, after all…♪\nI’m sure the reason the big names of the agency have selected AKATSUKI is because… it was convenient for them.\n\nYeah. AKATSUKI has been obedient and well-behaved, fundamentally.\nThere was a little bit of dispute over Unification by Force5, but we got to have that chalked up as a child’s typical rebellious phase.\nBesides, I imagine the success of Rumbling Heaven and Earth R was a big factor for the big names.\nWhen it came to thinking about who should be their successors, AKATSUKI was massively convenient for them.\n\nWell, this sort of thing more or less happens at any kind of agency, doesn’t it?\n\nI suppose. That’s why I can’t say I don’t understand all of their intentions.\nIt&#39;s not a bad thing to do, thinking about what the future might look and acting to keep the agency alive.\n\nI’ve got no intention of going down with the ship with those senile old badgers either.\n\nHey, watch your mouth. You went to the trouble of building a support-base, don’t say things that’ll just destroy it. You never know who or where someone might be listening from.\n\nOh? Pardon my insolence ☆\n\nDon’t pull out that cheekiness. That kind of thing isn’t cute whatsoever when it’s a grown man doing it.\nAnyways. I don’t have a problem with being promoted or getting backed by the agency. I have a problem with how they’ll handle AKATSUKI.\nOur unit’s image— they’ll underscore it, squeeze us into its mold, and won’t allow any deviations from it. That’s the kind of unit they want us to be.\nThey won’t let us try anything new. They’ll say we don’t need to keep up with the trends of the times.\nHaving cemented our image, they have no desire to see us grow or evolve. It’s as if we’ve been stuffed, taxidermied and put on display. There’s no soul or anything in that.\nThat’s a fine position to be in while it’s still trendy, but nothing stays in fashion forever. People get tired of it sooner or later.\nAnd when that happens, I imagine that those who hoisted us up to the top wouldn’t intend to scoop us right back up.\nWe’ll be labeled as washed-up idols and vanish from the center stage before you know it.\n\nI’ve seen that kind of treatment a lot in the past— people who stepped back into the shadows and vanished without a trace.\n\nRight. And the next victim will be AKATSUKI.\n\nStill, it&#39;s dangerous to confront the agency head-on just because you don&#39;t take to their motives. It’d be too short-sighted.\n\nOf course I understand that. That’s exactly why I intend to make my intentions clear for AKATSUKI, as implicitly as I can, before they can ensnare us in their arms.\n\nHm, I see.\n\nAKATSUKI is certainly a unit whose basic theme has been &quot;harmony&quot;6, but I want to make it clear to them that we’re not idols who get trapped in the old and outdated— we’re idols who live in the present.\nWe still have the opportunity to do something about it, but I just can&#39;t come up with a good way to do it.\n\nI see. Think it might be better to do a live show like DEADMANZ?7 If the honors students go instant-delinquent, it’ll shock just about everyone.\n\nAbsolutely not. They’ve been keeping a close eye on AKATSUKI’s activities lately. Whenever it starts to look like I’m straying from the path laid out for us, there’s been more and more interference.\nEven if I were to arrange a DEADMANZ Live, it would be squashed in seconds.\nNow, if I were to do that, the single best way would be to slip under the radar of the higher ups’ while still helping the audience understand AKATSUKI’s changes, though…\n\nThen for that, it might be fruitful to do something like make major rearrangements of your live songs.\n\nMaybe AKATSUKI should learn how to do at least one rap after all…? I heard that rapping sutra chants has become trendy lately.\n\nYou’re definitely swerving off course too much now.\nAnyways. I said I’d give you advice, but if it&#39;s something that important, wouldn&#39;t it be better to discuss it with AKATSUKI properly?\nAfter all, I don’t surround myself with AKATSUKI— my advice is that of an outsider at the end of the day.\n\n… That’s something hard to hear right now.\n\nI can sort of guess the reason why you hesitate to talk to them about it, but... Your guys are just as well-matched to mine, and they don&#39;t seem all that weak, no?\n\n…\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ This takes place before 4piece.↑ Referencing Heaven and Earth, AKATSUKI's climax story, where they revive a show called Rumbling Heaven and Earth into Rumbling Heaven and Earth R.↑ In Heaven and Earth, AKATSUKI has to juggle and cater to the needs of three veterans called the Three Sages.↑ A portable shrine carried over the shoulders, during festivals.↑ Referencing Unification by Force, where Kuro struggles to make outfits that are approved by the Rhythm Link higher ups; in Swiftly Cut 5, Kuro tells Souma that Keito argues with the higher-ups when the proposal was turned down.↑ 和 (wa) refers to a foundational cultural value in Japan that emphasizes social harmony through maintaining peaceful relationships within a group. 和 encourages compromise, consensus, and the avoidance of open conflict.

It’s rare to see you in a place like this. What are you doing\n\nOh, danna. You came at a good time. Couldja tell me what this word means?\n\nEnglish reference books..? Were you studying?\n\n Yeah. Actually, Kanzaki asked me a question about English grammar the other day. It was something I could answer, but…\nSeems like he’s unbelievably bad at English. Did you know about that, danna?\n\nNo… He has a serious disposition, so I was under the impression he could study just as diligently.\nCome to think of it, there are times where he struggles with English words we use on a daily basis.\n\n Right? Seems he can handle other subjects better than average, but English is the one thing he just can&#39;t do.\nSeein’ him like that got me worried, but I&#39;m not that good at studying myself. That’s how I ended up here, reviewin’ it.\n\nI see… I’m starting to get worried, too… I don’t think it’ll affect his grades, but still…\nOkay. I have some reference books and vocabulary flashcards I can recommend, so stay here. I’ll bring them.\n\nAlright, thanks. It&#39;s reassurin&#39; to know you’re willin’ to help us out, danna.\n\nWith Tsukasa\n\n    Location: School Store\n\n\nThere’s no urgent work today. Now and again, I have lunch at the school store, so I thought I’d come by, but…\nWhy is there nothing but soybean bread left?\nThe sign says “Now half-off the regular price!&#39;&#39;, but there’s still so much left over… As I figured, it’s not very popular.\nI don&#39;t like soybeans either. It&#39;s not something I’m going to force myself to eat. It&#39;s a pain, but I have no choice but to go to the cafeteria.\n\nOh, Hasumi-senpai? Hello. The bread in the school store is exquisite. I also come here quite often.\n\nSuou? . . I don&#39;t want to eat soybean bread, even if it’s exquisite.\nFrom what I see, you seem to have bought a different kind of bread. I can’t believe you managed to buy them in time.\n\nAs soon as the bell rang to signal the end of class, I headed straight to the school store.\nThe first year’s classrooms are close to the school store, so if you walk quickly, you can buy the popular bread ♪\nUm, Hasumi-senpai. If you don&#39;t like the bread there, do you want to exchange it for the bread I bought?\n\nIs that okay…? It would help. To be honest, it’s not that they’re inedible: I just really don&#39;t like soybeans. I was just thinking about going to the cafeteria instead.\n\nI see, so Hasumi-senpai doesn&#39;t like soybeans. From now on, I will refrain from giving you anything with soybeans in it.\nBut why is there so much surplus today? Is it a purchase order Mistake?\n\nWho knows... Suou, I&#39;m starting to feel a little sick, so I&#39;ll wait outside.\nJeez, I don&#39;t think I can ever overcome soybeans.\n\nWith Mao\n\n    Location: Cafe\n\n\nMm. This coffee is delicious.\n\nHm… There aren’t any seats left. I guess it can’t be helped… I’ll check another store.\n\nIsara…? I didn’t expect to meet you in a place like this.\nThe seat in front of me is empty, so why don&#39;t you sit down?\n\nOh, vice president? ! Um, is that okay? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m meeting someone.\n\nI&#39;m alone, so it’s fine. I’m ordering a refill of coffee, but what about you, Isara?\n\nWell, it&#39;s the same for me... Um, do you come to this store often?\n\nNot really. I only come every once in a while whenever I feel like drinking coffee.\nWell, usually I have Japanese tea, though... What? Even if you look at me like that, I won&#39;t let you have my chiffon cake.\n\nA-Ah, it’s not that– Er… There&#39;s just something unusual to me about the vice president having cake.\n\nHmph, even I eat something like this once in a while. Putting that aside, it seems that what I asked for has arrived.\nIt&#39;s normal for the student council to be busy, so it&#39;s important to take breaks.\nIt’s been a while since we’ve seen each other, so it&#39;d be nice to take our time catching up over coffee.\n\nWith Yuzuru\n\n    Location: Archery Hall\n\n\nI’m coming in.\n\nAh, Hasumi-sama. Are you participating in the archery club&#39;s activities today?\n\nYes. I finished my student council work early, so I thought I’d show up for once.\nJudging from appearances, it’s just you Fushimi. Were you practicing alone?\n\nNo. I was simply cleaning.\n\nAhh, I’m grateful that you do this without me having to ask.\nIt’s thanks to you that the archery range is kept tidy, Fushimi. You have my thanks.\n\nThere’s no need to thank me. I&#39;m a member of the archery club, and cleaning is my hobby.\nHasumi-sama, the only thing I have left to do is clean the floor… Could you please wait in the changing room until it&#39;s finished?\nHowever, I&#39;d feel terrible to keep you waiting, so I&#39;ll prepare something for you to drink afterwards.\n\nHey, I’m not a customer. We’re both members of the archery club, so let me help with the cleaning, too.\n\nBut I cannot allow Vice President-sama himself to do such a thing．\n\nI told you to call me by my last name during club activities. I’m also a member of the archery club, so we’ll do the cleaning together.\nBesides, the sooner we do it, the sooner it will be over. Let&#39;s put in some elbow grease every now and then.\n\nWith Kaoru\n\n    Location: Rooftop\n\n\nHakaze, you&#39;ve come at the right time. I have something to talk to you about．\n\nMm, well I don&#39;t, so cut me a break please~ Your lectures are too long, Hasumi-kun, so I don’t really care for them.\n\nHmph, it&#39;s your own fault for doing things that need lecturing.\nHakaze, you’ve been leaving your surfboard here without permission, haven’t you? Take it home immediately.\n\nWell, it&#39;s the perfect place for air-drying it~ It’s not like it’s bothering anyone if I hang it out here, so it&#39;s fine, right?\n\nIt’s not fine. We’ve been telling students not to store personal items on campus without permission.\n\nYeah, yeah. You’re not very accommodating, are you Megane-kun~?\n\nWho are you calling &quot;Megane-kun&quot;? If you really want to store it on the roof, take the appropriate steps…\n\nLook, let’s put that aside, have you seen Transfer student-chan, Hasumi-kun?\n\nThe transfer student? No, I haven&#39;t. Did you need something from her?\n\nYeah, kinda~ But if she isn&#39;t here, there&#39;s no point sticking around the rooftop anymore. I&#39;ll be going. Bye bye~\n\nWait, Hakaze, this conversation isn&#39;t over!\nHey, don’t ignore me! Listen to people when they’re talking to you!1\n\nWith Madara\n\n    Location: Student Council Room\n\n\n……\n\nExcuse meeee~!\n\nUwaa, you startled me?! Hey, Mikejima! Knock before you enter a room!\n\nHahaha, you sound a liiittle like Shu-san.\nAaanyways, your smartphone slipped out of your hand Keito-san.\nI grabbed it right before it hit the floor so I don’t think it broke, but… Please check just to be sure!\n\n…… Ah, it’s fine.\nSince you picked it up for me, I should at least show my gratitude. Thank you, Mikejima.\n\nYou don’t need to thank meee. Aaanyway, I caught a glimpse of your screen when I picked it up. You read books on your phone, huh, Keito-san?\n\nI do so every once in a while, yes. Hardcovers are too heavy to carry around, so I just read them as e-books sometimes, that’s all.\nMore importantly, you came to the student council room for business, right Mikejima?\nWhat did you need? It’s just me right now, but I can handle almost anything you need on my own.\n\nWell, here. I created a live proposal, so I was hoping you would check to see if it’s good enough!\n\nHmm… Do you mind if it takes a little while? I want to review it properly.\n\nNo problem at aaall~ While I&#39;m waiting, I&#39;d like to read the book you were reading earlier, Keito-san. Could you tell me the title of it?\nFrom the sentence I read earlier, it seemed interesting. Consider me intrigued.\n\nAh, if you like, I don’t mind if you read it on my phone.\nIt’ll have to be later, but when I get home I can grab my paperback and lend it to you.\nI doubt you’re the type to hold back, but let me know what you think about it.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n↑ Comic World (which takes place in summer) reveals that Keito ends up doing the paperwork for Kaoru himself."},{"title":"The Legend of KAGETSU | Wind of Silver, Dancing Autumn Leaves","url":"/translation//legend_of_kagetsu/wind_of_silver_dancing_autumn_leaves/","content":"\n\n\n \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                                                         \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Proofreader\n                \n                \n                    Anonymous, citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Season\n                \n                \n                    Summer\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nWind of Silver, Dancing Autumn Leaves 1\n\n    The same day.

However things may be, you mustn’t die when you’re still so young!\nI’m sorry. It had completely slipped my mind that you get motion sick, Kiryu-dono.\n\nSorry, Kiryu. I’d made the spur-of-the-moment decision to come to Okinawa too…\nWhat’s more, we didn’t have the time to spare to take a boat this time,2 so we took a flight, which Kiryu hates the most.\n\n… Sorry, sorry. I’m done for—\n\nMn~nn. Kiryu gets really weak when his motion sickness comes around. And still, it’s even worse than it was when we went by boat last time.\nAre you alright, Kiryu? If your heart is weak, your body will be weak. Bolster your spirit! You’re a strong young man!\n\nU–Urgh… Qu–Quit it, don’t rub my back like that while sayin’ that… I’m really gonna fuckin’ hurl my guts out. I’m seriously, seriously tryin’ to keep it in.\n\nI see, sorry. I’ll go buy you some nice, cold water, then.\n\nNah, it’s fine.

He&#39;s gotten to the point of cursing the theory of evolution.\n\nI suppose the extreme situation left him completely disoriented. Let’s just do as he wanted and leave him alone for now.\n\nRight. Well then, while Kiryu-dono’s recovering, we should think about our next steps.\nHasumi-dono. How did calling Taki go? Did you manage to reach him?\n\n… No good. It seems like he shut off his phone after our last call.\nBut that’s a problem. If we really can&#39;t get in touch with Taki, we don&#39;t know which direction we should go. Maybe we were too hasty...\n\nBut Taki&#39;s behavior doesn’t make sense at all. Our actions won’t be for naught if he&#39;s gotten himself involved in some kind of trouble.\nHasumi-dono. If we don’t know Taki’s whereabouts, I have an idea.\n\nHm? What is it?\n\nHow about we try asking passersby in town about it?\n\nAsk the townspeople…? It&#39;s a bit of a long shot that that would help us garner anything new, isn&#39;t it?\n\nPardon the quick aside, but this is according to my distant relatives who live in a tiny village.\nEveryone in the community knows of everyone else who lives there. Because of that, even if you’re unfamiliar with where you’re at, if you ask someone, they&#39;ll guide you to where they live.\nWhen it comes to towns and villages that are more closed off, everyone tends to be acquainted with each other and such. I figured if we have no other options, it might be a good idea to try it out.\n\nHmm… You’re right. We certainly aren’t learning anything new about Taki just standing here. It’s probably a better use of our time if we go and ask about him around town.\nGot it. We’ll go ask around while we wait for Kiryu to recover. In doing so, we might be able to put some clues together about Taki’s phone call.\n\n\n    Fade to black.\n\n\n(Sigh)... I’ve had it real fuckin’ rough… They’d better invent a “door to anywhere”3 real fuckin’ soon so vehicles can get wiped off the face of the map…— hm?\n\n(Humming)...♪\n\nYer a lil’ too giddy, Kanzaki. Keep it up and Taki’s not gonna be the only lost kid ‘round here.\n\nForgive me, Kiryu-dono. As expected, Okinawa&#39;s towns are curious, and they have all kinds of things that catch your attention. Last time we were here, I was preoccupied with things like “Ess-Ess”4 and orders.\n\nWell, I get how ya feel. I was lookin’ forward to just gettin’ to sightsee this time, y’know. I’m already bad with vehicles as it is, goin’ to far-off places is tough, though.\n\nWell, if we can find Taki quick enough, we might have time to do a little sightseeing around town.\nNow then. Looks like we got to a place with a sizable amount of foot traffic, more or less. Who should we ask about Taki…?\nNaturally, It’d look way too suspicious to suddenly stop a passerby to ask…\nHere, I’ll go ask that shopkeeper over there\nPardon me, are you busy?\n\n\nHm? Menso~re5, how may I help you~?\n(Displaying his phone) I&#39;m looking for the person in this photo: do you happen to know who this is? His name is Taki Ibuki and apparently, he’s here in Okinawa.\n\nTakiii…?\n\n(Figures, of course they wouldn’t know…)\n\nHmm? Oh. That’s Majimun’s6 little oni~\n\nWhat!? You know who he is!?\n\nHahaha! Obviously~ Nobody who lives around here doesn’t know ‘em~ That little oni is Majimun’s grandchild~\n\nMajimun…?\n\nSo you’re looking for the little oni, hm~ If you want to meet up with him, you should go to Majimun’s place~\nHere, I’ll jot down a map~ Please wait a moment, ‘kay~?\n\n\n    Fade to black.\n\n\n... “Majimun”7. It’s a generic term for evil spirits and youkai in the Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands of the Kagoshima Prefecture. That’s what it said on the internet, anyways.\n\nTaki’s grandfather is a youkai? … Does that mean Taki is one too…?\nSo he was a real life youkai… Up until now, I never particularly believed in that sort of thing, though.\n\nAre you someone who takes things at face value? There’s no way that’s it. “Majimun” is probably just a nickname the locals gave Taki’s grandfather.\n\nWell? Here’s the place that shopkeep marked on the map for us.\nSo this is the home that Taki and that Majimun guy live in, huh?\nThere’s a nameplate… “Gajumaru Home”8 Taki’s grandpa sure has a weird last name.\n\nIt seems like a family name Sengoku would be excited to have– very ninja-esque. “Gajuu-maru” Shinobu.\n\nOi. This isn’t the time for dumb conversations, is it?\n\nHey, it can’t be helped. Look, that’s what it says on the nameplate.\n\nGajumaru is the name of a plant. It’s not a last name.\nWith a name like that, this place might not just be a home, but some kind of facility too.\n\n— Hasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono! Please look! There– Running into the garden– it’s Taki!\n\nWhat!?\n\nWind of Silver, Dancing Autumn Leaves 2\n\n— Taki! You baaaastard!\n\nUuuweh!?\n\nOnly ever acting as you please! Get over here right now! I’ll hack off that half-willed disposition for you!\n\nTaki, you little—! I got stuck on some plane, thanks to you, you got it!? Time for you to settle your debts, hear me!?\n\nHasumi-san, Kanzaki-san, Kiryu-san…?\nWhat are you guys doing here~? Am I having some kinda convenient dream…?\n\nWhat are you playing stupid for? This isn’t a dream. After your call, we hopped on a plane right away to get here.\nDon’t think you can just end things with a single nonsense phone call. We don’t plan on going back home until we hear a proper reason from your very own mouth, Taki.\n\nThat’s…!\n…\n… So you went out of your way to come all the way south? What hard work for something so pointless, huh~ just how nice can you guys be~ Y’know you’d be real easy pickings in America in an instant, right~?\nSorry you took the time to come all the way here, but I hafta head out from here now.\nI already said everything in that phone call. I’ve got nothing left to say to you~\nGot it? If you do, go back home now~\n\nTell us why you dropped out of the live.\n\n\nAww man, how surprisingly insistent~ Hasumi-san! You want a reason? Then I’ll say it. It’s as simple as this: I got bored~ That’s all it is. Happy now!?\n\nYou—! How much more dishonorable and ungrateful can you be!\nSeeing how diligently you’d practiced, I’d thought there were signs of promise, but! I was a fool to have such expectations for you!\n\n\n…—\nIt’s annoying, getting expectations put on me when I didn’t ask for them~ I’m an oni. I don’t belong anywhere, my very existence brings misfortune to people.\n… Someone like me shouldn’t have stepped into a community of humans, y’know~\n\nWhat are you talking about…? You’re a human.\n\nNope~ I’m an oni, y’know~ An oni that wanted to be human. Or maybe, an oni that tried to become human.\n\nSo Taki really was a youkai after all?\n\nThat’s absurd… Well, whatever, it doesn’t matter if you’re an oni or a human. If you got sick of it, tell us how things got to that point. Besides, there’s something I need to talk to you about too—\n\nYou’ve been persistent for a while now, Hasumi-san…\n\n...!\n\nIf you’re saying you’re not going back, I’ll make you go back~ You know my strength, right~? I don’t think I’d lose, even against all three of you~\n\nYou wouldn’t want to get something like injuries right before a really important live, now would you~?\n\n… Oi. Danna. This bloodlust… looks like Taki&#39;s serious ‘bout it.\n\n...\nFine by me. If that’s what you want to do, do it.\n\n\nHah…? Is this your true nature, Hasumi-san? Ahh, maybe you think I’m bluffing? I’m serious—\n\nI don’t think you’re bluffing. Your spirit speaks for itself.\nSo, if that brings you peace of mind, you can do as you like. I didn’t come here half-hearted in the first place.\n\nWh– What’re you…\n\nWe’re not going anywhere until we talk it out with you.\n\nU– Uuu…\n— Y-You…\n\nYou…?\n\n\nYou idiOOOOOOT! If you wanna stay here so bad, go ahead and do whatever you want, ‘kay?! I don&#39;t care anymore, you hear me~!?\nEven though… Even though you—! You taught me it stood for the shape of compassion, so—! And yet you— idiOOOOOT!\n\n\n...\n\n...\nErr… Taki said what he wanted to say, and then completely ran off…?\n\n… He took off with such force, we forgot to stop him.\n\nWhat was that all about? He went all brat-mode — Actually, come to think of it, Taki is still a kid, huh? He’s younger than Tetsu after all.\nEven so, what do we do, Hasumi? Taki— the whole reason we came here — ran off. Should we go after him? With how crazy athletic Taki is, it’s gonna be real hard to catch up with him from here...\n\nHmm. With Taki gone, there’s no point staying. We’ll have to go after him.\n\nOutsiders! 9 What’re you doing on my land~? Here to steal more than just the deed, huh!?\n\nWhoa!? That surprised me…!\n\nHasumi-dono. An old man has come out of the house… Could that gentleman be Taki’s grandfather?\n\nAnd he’s all banged up, too. Old Man, you alright? What happened to you?\n\n? You’re not punks…?\n… Could you lot be the ones called AKATSUKI~?\n\nWind of Silver, Dancing Autumn Leaves 3\n\nEveryone. Come, please, have some tea ♪\n\nI’m sorry for letting my guests make the tea~ If I weren’t injured, I’d have made it myself~\n\nThink nothing of it. I enjoy brewing tea.\nBy the way, Elder-sir,10 there seem to be quite a lot of children here. Are they all your grandchildren?\n\nHahaha. Not quite~ These little ones are my grandchildren in every way but blood~ This is an orphanage, you see~\n\nOrphanage? Does that mean Taki’s…?\n\nAhh, Ibuki’s different~ I raised him just like the other kids, but he’s my true grandchild~\nWell, even without the blood relation, Ibuki probably thinks of this lot like a big pack of siblings.11\nWell? Why did you all come here~? I heard from Ibuki that you’re idols working over on the mainland~\nThe truth is, Taki was supposed to perform on stage with us as our guest for our upcoming live.\nAll of a sudden, he told us to pretend the whole thing never happened, without giving a reason...\nWe couldn’t accept it, so we went after him in order to talk with him.\n\nHahah, I see~ That damn fool... “Taking some time off”, my ass~ Don&#39;t go lying to your grandpa.\nHasumi-san, was it? I’m real sorry. I’m the reason Ibuki came rushing back home~\n\nWhat do you mean by…?\n\nThere’s been talk of some big entertainment facility being built on Hoshijima~12\n\nThere’s a recreational facility…?\n\n… It’s probably ATLANTIS, the amusement park. I’m pretty sure Himemiya and Eichi are involved with it.\nFrom what I overheard, they even managed to get the local residents on board, and ATLANTIS’s operations and construction had begun again, but... Are there disagreements over ATLANTIS again?13\n\nAhh, no. That so-called “Atorantisu”14 is whatever~ If anything, I welcome it.\nI don’t care for all the racket, but if it’s got talk starting up about Okinawa, there’s a lot of people who are gonna be pleased with it~ Seems the kids are pleased too.\nBut things that are too-good-to-be-true like that always come with things like an underside~ If something looks to be profitable, there are gonna be bad guys who zero in on it~\nFrom here on out, Okinawa is going to be more prominent, so the price of the land that’s here is getting awfully high, now~\nAnd so, rogues from the mainland are targeting this land.\nI used to be feared as Oni back in the day, but ever since I threw out my back a few years ago, I haven’t been in the same shape~\nThey forced the deed from me just yesterday~\n\nOi, oi. Is that where those injuries came from…?\n\nHahaha. What a damn shame~ I can’t beat out Father Time and what he’s got in store for me~\n\nWh– What horrific violence to enact against an elderly man…! Where are those thugs!? Their blood will become the rust on my sword in an instant!\n\nOhh, wow, you’re a real passionate one, huh~ Just hearing you say that is enough for me, you~ know~? I know myself— I won’t let Ibuki’s visitors take on that responsibility~\n\nBesides, that kid flew out in a rage, so~ It’ll be fine~\n\nCould it be that the reason Taki flew out of here a moment ago was… That he was heading out to where the rogues are to take back the stolen deed?\n\nYes, that’s right~ I had gotten in touch with him yesterday, and he’d come back this morning~ It surprised even me.\nDamn shame— I can’t do anything myself, so I can do nothing but rely on my grandchild, but...\nI have to protect this place no matter what it takes~ Without it, these kids will have nowhere left to turn~\nSo I’m really glad Ibuki came back to help~ But I feel bad for the trouble it caused you all~\n\n\n… Damn it, that Taki. That’s a proper reason to have, right? Why didn’t he mention it earlier? If he’d just told us that, there were plenty of ways we could have worked around it.\n\nThat’s right. Even if you were to ask me to choose between a job or my family, it would be difficult to make a swift decision and act upon it— much less condemn Taki for choosing his family. I can’t do that.\nEven so, the way he was acting back there— rejecting us point-blank without divulging the reason…\n\n… So that’s how it is. I get it now.\n\n? What’s the matter, Hasumi?\n\nThe way he acted before— Taki was probably putting on an act.\n\nWhat do you mean by that…?\n\nI’ve been thinking through what Taki had said back there— “You taught me it stood for the shape of compassion, so—!” — and what it meant…\nIt was a series of lies to act as etiquette; he almost certainly wanted to try and keep AKATSUKI from getting wrapped up in it. He’s an idiot in every sense of the word. How incorrigible.\n… Er, sorry. I spoke badly of your grandchild…\n\nHahaha. It’s fine, Ibuki’s always been a big old dolt~ That aside, you&#39;re all waiting for him, right~?\n\nYes. Having heard everything that was said, I realize there’s still things I haven’t said yet.\n\nThat right? It’s gotten dark out, so stay here for the night~ We’ve got plenty of rooms.\nI don’t know how roughed up he’ll be when he gets back, but he’ll be home by around midnight~ Let’s leave the conversation for tomorrow~ How’s that sound~?\n\nWind of Silver, Dancing Autumn Leaves 4\n\n(Yawn) Ahh…\n\nGood morning, Kiryu.\n\nI’ve never slept in such a ginormous hall like this, so I had a hard time noddin’ off.\n\nIs that so? It made me feel nostalgic and reminded me of home, though.\n\nYour house is huge as hell, Kanzaki. Anyways, what’re you guys talkin’ about.\n\nWe were discussing whether we should make breakfast as thanks for letting us stay the night.\n\nOhh, that sounds pretty nice, huh? I’m not as good as you, Kanzaki, but I can help with the small things.\n\nIbuki! Where are you~ Ibuki!\n\n… Hm? Was that Taki’s grandfather’s voice just now?\nGood morning. What’s going on?\n\nAhh, Hasumi-san?\nIt’s just that… I don’t know where Ibuki&#39;s gone~  It looks like he didn’t return from yesterday.\n\nEh? That sounds pretty serious, doesn’t it…?\n\nI doubt Ibuki would lose to a bunch of rogues like those guys, though~\nUp until now, they knew they couldn&#39;t win when Ibuki was here, so they didn’t make a move on this place.\n\nIf that&#39;s the case, then it&#39;s all the more worrisome that he hasn&#39;t returned home yet...\n\n… Though, he is the kinda guy who’s sloppy and screws up at the last second~ Could something unexpected have happened…?\n\n…\n\n\n    Fade to black.\n\n\n…\n… U–...gugh…?\n(How long have I been out…? It’s light outside…? Is it already morning?)\n\n(It hurts… Since I didn’t fight back, they beat me up to their heart’s content.)\n\n(Where are…?)\n\n(... Ahh, those guys are bunched up all the way over there, having a lighthearted chat~ ‘Cuz they’re in such high spirits that they took me down.)\n\n(What’s that? They aren’t keeping watch ‘cuz my hands are tied behind my back? You've really made a fool out of me, the Oni you feared.)\n\n(Yeah, I really shoulda just beat the hell outta them instead of holding back or whatever~)\n\n(... But I couldn’t do it.)\n\n(It’s ‘cuz Hasumi-san and the others meddled and came all the way to Okinawa to pick me back up~)\n\n(Their faces kept popping up in my mind, so I just couldn't get myself to throw a punch. There’s just no way I can cause trouble for AKATSUKI by going on a rampage.)\n\n(Well, I stood them up in rehearsal and came back to Okinawa without asking in the first place, so at this point, even if I rampage here, there's no way I can go back there again, huh~?)\n\n[A deep sigh.]\n\n(Hasumi-san and the others got so mad~ I wonder if they’ve gone home already… Having said all that I did, definitely~)\n\nThis was for the best. To protect both of us…\n\n(I can't avoid a fight anyways~ ‘Cuz I gotta get the deed back at all costs~ There’s absolutely no way I can let these guys have that house~)\n\n(My siblings’d be left with nowhere to go, after all. I gotta leave ‘em a home to come back to, at the very least.)\n\n(Taki Ibuki. Hesitate, and you’ll lose everything, y’know~? You have to bolster yourself, okay~?)\n\n(If it comes to getting out of this bind… What to do…)\n(Well, it’s fine~ I was a lil’ reckless. It&#39;s not like I have another live show, so… If I dislocate my shoulder and the joints of my fingers, I can rampage as long as my dominant arm is in good shape. Then—)\n(Hm? The sound of footsteps…? Did those guys get reinforcements or something?)\n\n\nTaki! Are you here!?\n\nWhat the– You guys!\n\nOop. Looks like this warehouse is right on the mark, Hasumi. There’s all sorts of shady guys hangin’ around this place.\n\nHasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono. Taki— he’s here. He’s collapsed all the way back here, on the ground!\n\nAre you alright? Taki!\n\n… You guys!? Wh— Why did you come here! I told you to go away…!\n\nAre you guys associates of that old man’s place?\n\nReal cheap move bullying a brat— quit it. Fork over Taki and the deed to the land.\n\nAll of your insolent acts of violence will not be pardoned. If you’re unwilling to comply with these demands, you will only have yourselves to blame when we hack you down.\n\nWh… Are you lookin’ for a fight?\n\n\nHold it, Kiryu, Kanzaki. I’ll negotiate this. Don’t proceed any further.\n\nEhh!? That’s extremely dangerous no matter how you look at it, Hasumi-dono!\n\nHe’s right, Danna. I mean, when it comes to fightin’... you should leave this sorta thing to me ‘n Kanzaki.\n\nShut it. What are you talking about, “fighting”. We are the idols of AKATSUKI. I won’t permit raising trouble right before a live show.\n\nWhat the— They sent out the scrawniest guy, huh? You sure you’re not gonna use the two in the back, Megane-kun?\n\nDon’t make fun of the glasses. Are you going to hand over Taki and the deed to the land?\nI&#39;ve arranged for the police to be contacted if we don&#39;t return after a set amount of time. If you don&#39;t want to get arrested, you&#39;d better get out of here quickly.\n\nWhat the…?\n\nYou guys don&#39;t want to make this public and aggravate the situation, right? We can still settle this personal dispute if we keep it here. Hand over Taki and the deed to the land and leave here at once.\n\nIt’s pointless~ Hasumi-san! Those guys aren’t open to conversation.\n\nHahaha. You’re a real lively one, huh. But you’re a moron. Like that brat said, there’s no way we’re backing out of an opportunity this lucrative.\n\nGh…! Unhand me. Do you hear me? The police will be arriving any moment!?\n\nThat right? Guess we’ll have to settle this nice little conversation before they get here. Everyone, grab ‘em. If we move ‘em outta here, the police aren’t gonna find anything here.\n\n! We’ve been surrounded. At this rate, we’re gonna get captured.\n\nHasumi-dono. Permission to engage–\n\nNo. Obviously, I’m not going to permit that.\n\nHey, stop it! These guys aren’t involved with me! You’ve got business with me, right~? They’ve got nothing to do with me~!\nI don’t owe it to you to listen to what you have to say, hear me? Completely pulverizing the lot of you here makes for a better chat, after all! Like this…!\n\nGhh…!\n\nHasumi-san!\n\nHasumi—!\n\nHasumi-dono—!\n\n… Settle down. I’m fine, I just got shoved and fell over.\n\n…\n… You just crossed the line you never shoulda crossed~ It’s different if it’s just me, but Jii-chan15 and Hasumi-san… ‘Course, you just pissed me the hell off~\n\n… O–Oi, Taki?\n\nWind of Silver, Dancing Autumn Leaves 5\n\n… I didn’t want to cause trouble for AKATSUKI, so I thought I’d hold back when I fought you~\nBut, figures, my patience’s got limits~ If I hold myself back and I can’t protect what I want to protect, there’s no point to it~\nReally, you guys should have to be tried under law, but it’d be a big problem if you got crafty and snaked your way out of a civil suit, so~\nIf that’s how it’s gonna be, I’ll subject you to your judgement myself~\n\nYou— When the hell—!? How the hell’d you get out of your restraints!?\n\nNyahaha. All I had to do was dislocate my shoulder to wiggle out of it~ It hurts just a lil’, but~ this is real cute compared to how fights in America went, y’know~\n\nT— Taki. Hold on, calm down…\n\nYou guys really pissed me off. Ready to cause a rebellion, ready to pick a fight, I’m the descendant of an oni that can silence even crying children. I’ll get my well-earned reward, and after that~ I’ll be getting the deed too, ‘kay~\nBrace yourself~!\n\n… Ahh. I wanted to keep things from getting to this point, though… How incorrigible…\n\nOhh. I thought that Taki guy was all talk, but nah— turns out he’s ragin&#39; like a real fierce deity16 ♪\n\nI see. While he runs about as he pleases, he brings down each person one-by-one, hm?\n\nWell, if you’re takin’ on multiple people by yourself, hit-and-run tactics from person-to-person is just the basics.\n\nIs this the time to be having fun watching it like a sports match?!\n\n… Hm? But the damage his body has sustained is starting to rack up, understandably. He seems exhausted.\n\nAh, shit, that’s bad… Before long, he’s gonna run outta gas ‘n things are gonna go bad real quick.\nWe should go back him up before that happens. Shall we go and get to it, Kanzaki?\n\nOf course. Who are you asking here, Kiryu-dono. I’d like it if you didn’t underestimate me. I am always prepared to do battle.\n\nHah? Kiryu, Kanzaki. Hold it. Just now, I heard you say you would go back him up, but…\n\nLook. If there’s no backup, Taki’s gonna get pummeled before long, right? That’s the grave situation we’ve got at hand.\n\n\nGh… That’s…\n… What’s with you all— Does this place have nothing but mad dogs in it…!?\n\nHahaha, mad dogs. You’re definitely not wrong. Well, it’ll be fine. There’s no shot it’ll end up as bad as you think it’s gonna be..\n\n… What makes you say that so confidently?\n\nIf ya don’t leave any eyewitnesses, who’s to say any crimes were committed here. And if we beat all the guys here to a pulp, then we’re not gonna have any eyewitnesses. So, how ‘bout you close yer eyes for a bit, Hasumi.\n\nAre you an idiot…!?\n\nJokes aside, leave it to me. I’ll help wrap things up here. Speakin’ from experience, it’s not gonna end up bad.\nWell, just take my word for it and close yer eyes.\n\n…\n\n\n    Fade to black.\n\n\nHasumi-dono. Everything’s been disposed of.\n\n\n    Keito opens his eyes.\n\nNyahaha. Kiryu-san and Kanzaki-san did it too, huh~\n\nI did not go too hard on them. But with such a clear difference in strength, it’s only natural they’d back off.\nBy the way, are you alright, Taki? Your shoulder didn’t get injured, did it?\n\nAhh. It’s just because I dislocated it on purpose~ I fixed it right after that, so~ it’s no biggie~\nI took back the deed too, the day’s saved~\n\nIs this really the time for you all to be feeling all refreshed after going on a rampage?\nI should say— Kiryu. What’s “it’ll be fine” about this, exactly? There are clearly signs of a violent struggle. What are we going to do if these guys take everything here as evidence of a crime?\n\nThey’re not gonna do that. These guys are the ones who picked the fight, how are they gonna have the nerve to go runnin’ to the police about it, huh?\nWhen it comes to fights that deal with shady dealings, they tend to get settled privately instead.\n\nSpeaking of the police…! If Hasumi-dono got in contact with the police, they should be arriving any moment, shouldn’t they!?\n\nThat… was a bluff. I wanted to keep things from getting to this point, and intended to negotiate with them, but… How incorrigible.\n\nWell, it’s whatever, isn’t it? They didn’t seem like people you could reason with anyways, so it turned out alright in the end.\n\nWhen we get back, you’re all in for a lecture. I think it’ll be half a day’s worth of seiza! — You included, Taki!\n\nEhh!? Me too!?\n\nOf course, you17 were the one who vanished in the first place!\n\nWait~ That’s~ Well there was nothing I could do about it~ What was I supposed to do if I heard these guys went and stormed my home~ Huh~?\n\nWe understand those feelings. It’s what happened after that’s the problem. You should’ve come to us about it properly.\n\nThat’s… Well, okay, maybe you could say that, but...\n\nTaki. What do you want to do from here on out? Tell us how you feel, honestly.\n\n… From here on out?\n\nWind of Silver, Dancing Autumn Leaves 6\n\nDo you intend to perform with AKATSUKI?\n\n…\nI do want to, deep down..\n… But, it’s just not possible~ I totally caused you trouble, after all~ So I’m taking responsibility~\nI’m a free spirit. ‘Course I know that much~ I know I’m an outsider.\nSo I won’t ask you to include me in the AKATSUKI live.\n\nInclude you in the AKATSUKI live…?\nI want all of you to listen to what I have to say right now.\n\nWhat ya gotta say, huh… Is it what you’ve been broodin’ over lately?\n\nYes, that’s right. AKATSUKI’s activities as of late have been absolutely remarkable.\n\nYes. We’ve had such upward momentum, we could take down birds in flight!\n\nBut that overblown response is manufactured by the higher-ups of the agency. It’s like they want to hoist up their ideal version of AKATSUKI like a mikoshi and parade it around.\nThey couldn’t accept the trends of the current age, so they were scheming to embody their ideal of classical performance through AKATSUKI.\n\n\nSo what you’re saying is that we’ve been deceived up until now…?\n\nNo, it’s not that. AKATSUKI’s work has been completely successful, and has been rightly evaluated as such.\nThe results we’re turning out are more than enough. We’re turning them out…\n\nI see, huh. There was somethin’ more behind all that praise. Honestly, it felt off gettin’ praised no matter what we did.\nI get that whether we like it or not, the world doesn’t always work out all well and good.\n\nSo you were guarding AKATSUKI through that, Hasumi-dono?\n\nI wouldn’t go so far as to say I was protecting it or something. I was just dodging and evading them once I realized what they were scheming, so those guys couldn’t get what they wanted out of us.\n\nIf that’s the case, you should have told us much earlier…!\nAre we that unreliable to you? Each time we come across hardship, we overcome it together, and each time I think that “This time, surely, he’ll put faith in us”, but—\nOnce again, you couldn’t rely on us for something important…!?\n\nNo. That’s not it.\n… I just… I didn’t want to do something like ruin the moment for those who were genuinely happy that AKATSUKI was receiving such praise...\nThere’s no way I could let wicked people who have nothing but ulterior motives in mind taint the pure hearts of those who work their hardest every day and celebrate their growth.\nBut in doing that, I ended up hurting you in a different way instead. I’m sorry.\n\nThe bounds of your overprotectiveness are real strange, you. What are you, a worrywart mother?\n\nI wanted to make it clear I wasn’t going to let them control AKATSUKI as they wished, while not opposing the agency&#39;s intentions straight-on.\nI tried everything in my power. I tried to adopt what was trendy into the arrangements of new AKATSUKI songs.\nBut the overall response never changed. Apparently, every song was “fit for AKATSUKI”.\nIt’s probably because I’m too steeped in the traditional performing arts that I can&#39;t get the range right. It&#39;s hard to strike a balance.\nIt was at that moment, in 4piece… In that audition where I came across Taki.\n\nEh? Then, the reason Hasumi-san called out to me was…\n\n\nThat’s right. When we had our jam session together, I felt like I could see the future of AKATSUKI.\nAKATSUKI is a unit that takes pride in the traditional performance arts.\nBut we’re not an antique or a curio; it’s not an antiquated unit. We’re idols who sing and dance in front of people who live in the now.\nEven if AKATSUKI’s performances change, AKATSUKI stays the same. Even if something on the surface changes, the soul of AKATSUKI is eternal.\n\n… That’s right. That’s what we learned from Rumbling Heaven and Earth.\n\nRight. We take the things we’ve cultivated in the past, change it to suit the modern age, and carry it with us into the new era.\nThe tradition that AKATSUKI should protect is “legacy”18, not “convention”19.\nTaki. You’ve been saying that we’re “letting you be involved in the live with AKATSUKI”.\nYou certainly are playing the role of guest, but what I want from you isn’t to be a guest; I want us to stand as equals.\nThat harmony20 of Japanese culture is the word &quot;harmony&quot;.21 \nThings like “Fitting just right” and “blending in seamlessly” are subtle, but unmistakable. That is what harmony is all about.\nIt doesn’t matter to me if you did something like cause us trouble like you said. Well, I am going to lecture you, though…\n\nNyahaha. I don’t wanna get a lecture though~?\n\nAKATSUKI is bringing you in to itself,22 Taki, and you are swallowing up23 AKATSUKI in return. Like that time in 4piece… I called out to you because I wanted to discover what new possibilities could be in store for AKATSUKI.\nSo, I’ll ask you one more time.\nDo you intend to perform with AKATSUKI?\n\n…\nI—\n\nWind of Silver, Dancing Autumn Leaves 7\n\nMnmn… Hammering in the practice to do such unfamiliar dance moves in such a short amount of time… because of that, my muscles are sore.\n\nHahaha, that’s muscle pain yer talkin’ about. Can’t believe the day’s come where Kanzaki’s the one talkin’ about  “muscle pain”.\n\nKanzaki’s never fallen behind in practice since the day he joined AKATSUKI, thanks to the fact he never misses a day to train.\nBut this song has choreography far different from anything we’ve done so far. I suppose it targeted muscles we never tend to use.\n\nHmmn. Kanzaki-san wasn’t familiar with it~? This kind of dance is way more familiar to me, though~ Vibes are key in America~\nMn. I’m familiar with it too. I’ve trained my “vai-bu”s since I was a child, after all.\n\nKanzaki, don’t pick meaningless things to compete about. Taki, stop teaching Kanzaki weird words.\n\nNyahahaha. By the way, how’d the stage for “The Legend of Kagetsu” end up~?\n\nRight, excellent. Thanks to the efforts of everyone, we’ll be able to show off everything we’ve worked hard to hone. I truly believe this will be the best show yet.\n\nThat’s good~ It was getting reaaal scary, cutting it so close up to the day of “The Legend of Kagetsu”\n\nTaki worked hard coming up with ideas, from the choreography to the arrangement, after all.\nThe original song “Tenshou Kagetsu”24 was made with AKATSUKI’s image in mind. By incorporating Taki’s arrangement into it, it became Tenshou KAGETSU25.\n\nThat’s what you expected from me, right Hasumi-san~? So? Did you end up liking how it turned out?\n\nYes. I think it turned out to be a good song that really fits the AKATSUKI of now.\n\n…♪\n\nWhat about the agency? Is Taki singin’ Tenshou KAGETSU with AKATSUKI not bein’ called into question? That’s what was bein’ said, right?\nIf we start separatin’ ourselves from the Japanese-style the agency wants outta the unit, they’ll probably retaliate, whether it&#39;s through words or somethin’ more..\n\nThat’s not going to be a problem: the higher-ups of the agency haven’t taken notice of Tenshou KAGETSU, after all.\nI imagine they still think we’re going to be singing the Tenshou Kagetsu they wanted, as the model honors students they wanted us to be.\n\nHaha, that’s good. I’ve never been an honors student from day one, anyways. Pickin’ a fight with a huge ass opponent gets my blood goin’.\nGuess you’re fine with us pickin’ that fight, huh, Hasumi-no-danna?\n\nYes. The curtain rises on a revolution— because in what world has one been achieved without waging war? Now, let’s go!\n\n\n♪~♪~♪\n♪~♪~♪\n\n(Ohh. Looks like the audience is all thrown off, ‘cuz this is different from the songs we usually do, huh.)\n(AKATSUKI doesn’t do showy performances. It was the kind of unit that showed off a commandin’ presence, even when we stood still.)\n(But, this is fine, right? It’d be a waste to stay confused. ‘Cuz this is proof that we’ve got all kinds of potential left to find.)\n\n(Right, I agree. Every day holds the chance to improve. Whether it’s for people or “yu-nnito”, that doesn’t change.)\n(That said, although they were hesitant at first, the audience has started to get more enthusiastic.)\n(I’ve gotten swept up in their excitement as well…! It’s a flustering exaltation different from anything I’ve felt thus far!)\n\n(That Kanzaki, having the nerve to be so lively and vivid…♪ He’s always given off the impression of someone laser-focused on the traditional performing arts, but turns out he’s open to this kinda thing too, huh.)\n\n♪~♪~♪\n\n(Nyahaha. This feels great! It looks like the opening’s going pretty well, huh~)\n(Maybe this kinda thing is the harmonious harmony20 Hasumi-san was talking about~?)\n(Both the Okinawan and American dispositions I carry with me, mixed with the harmony*27 AKATSUKI brings with them. At a glance, it doesn’t seem like it fits, but I blend right in. How strange~)\n(I’m absorbing26 the harmony* of this mainland. At times, I’m introducing harmony* from the American perspective too.)\n(— I’ll show you I’ll find that “true Japanese-style”.)\n\n♪♪♪\n(What Taki has that AKATSUKI doesn’t— it’s that thirst. And from that thirst comes a kind of hunger.)\n(In Japan, there is a tendency to view greed as despicable— something to be ashamed of. Because of that, I tried not to bring it to the surface. I had figured that restraint was a virtue.)\n(But I’ve had enough of moderation. AKATSUKI is a unit that honors good old fashioned harmony*, but we’re idols who make the most of the present and take on the future.)\n\n\n(“All worldly things are impermanent” is what the world runs on. If we only keep our eyes on the past and present, we’ll absolutely lose sight of the future.)\n(I won’t let that happen to AKATSUKI.)\n(Even if it’s despicable, I’ll hungrily take in everything, and aim for a harmony* that holds up in the face of the future.)\n♪~♪~♪\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ This is a callback to Submarine; it's the very first line of the story.↑ AKATSUKI take a boat to get to the SS Preliminaries in Submarine because of Kuro's motion sickness.↑ A reference to the Anywhere Door from Doraemon.↑ SS, where they were given secret orders to follow throughout the duration of Submarine.↑ An uchinaaguchi greeting, meaning &quot;Welcome&quot;.↑ The name used here is マ爺ムン (majimun), a pun on マジムン (majimun, an evil spirit) and 爺 (jii, the uchinaaguchi word for grandpa or old man). Up to this point, Majimun has been referred to as 鬼 (Oni) and 沖縄の鬼 (Okinawa's Oni). You can read the Ibuki Roadmap for more details.↑ As Keito explains, majimun are evil spirits in the Ryukyus. Shiisaa are said to protect people from majimun.↑ Gajumaru are banyan trees native to the Ryukyus (now Okinawa) and tropical Asia. In Okinawan folklore, thought to be home to kijimuna, youkai similar to fairies. They look like young children, and are known to be mischevous. Among their folklore, they're good at fishing and often befriend humans, but get angered by those who are careless or destroy the environment.↑ Majimun uses 余所者. Meanings include &quot;stranger&quot; or &quot;outsider&quot;.↑ Souma uses 祖父君 (sofugimi) here.↑ The word used here is 兄弟 (kyoudai). This can mean brothers or it can mean siblings (brothers and sisters). It's not confirmed whether the orphanage is specifically a boy's orphanage (Majimun calls them 子供たち, children), so I left it gender neutral.↑ Hoshijima is a fictional island off the coast of mainland Okinawa; it's the home to a side branch of Shinkai religion worshippers. It was first mentioned in Stella Maris. You can read the Ibuki Roadmap for more details.↑ In Stella Maris, construction for ATLANTIS is halted after some of the locals interfere in protest. After RYUSEITAI intervenes, ES and the locals come to an agreement to continue the development of ATLANTIS in return for the island receiving financial aid.↑ Majimun pronounces it with the hiragana あとらんちす.↑ Ibuki uses 爺ちゃん here for his grandfather.↑ 鬼神 (kishin), a fierce deity or divine being.↑ Souma uses 貴様 (kisama) here, a rude, confrontational second-person pronoun. Keito usually uses it.↑ 伝承 (denshou); Tradition in the sense of folklore, legends, passing things down.↑ 伝統 (dentou); Tradition in the sense of convention.↑ Because of its nuance and cultural significance for this story, I'll designate whenever 和 is used in the translation. 和 (wa) refers to a foundational cultural value in Japan that emphasizes social harmony through maintaining peaceful relationships within a group. 和 encourages compromise, consensus, and the avoidance of open conflict. Generally, it can refer to &quot;Japanese-ness&quot;, and is used in words like 和風 (wafu, Japanese style). Read the Unpacking Shinsei AKATSUKI note to learn about the problematic implications of this section.↑ The harmony Keito says here is 調和 (chouwa), which is more of an objective harmony or reconciliation.↑ 取り込む; to take something in, to bring in, to capture.↑ 飲み込む; to take something into yourself, to swallow, to engulf.↑ This is written out with the kanji 天翔華月.↑ This is written out as 天翔KAGETSU.↑ 吸収して; to absorb, to attract (inward).↑ If an asterisk (*) follows after &quot;harmony&quot; for the rest of the passage, this is a mention of 和 (wa)."},{"title":"Shinobu Management Stories","url":"/translation//shinobu_management_stories/","content":"\nNOTE: Management stories take place in early !-era spring, so they're a good gauge for relationships pre-development.\n \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\t\n                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \n                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\n                                                           \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Writer\n                \n                \n                    Happy Elements\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Proofreading\n                \n                \n                    310mc\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    Season: Early Spring [!]\n\nwith Makoto\n\n    Location: Hallway\n\n\n(Nnh. It feels like the second year&#39;s floor has such a dignified atmosphere. I’ve only just changed one floor, how is it so different?)\n(I can only hope I manage to conceal my presence until I reach Isara-dono&#39;s classroom…)\n\nHuh? Shinobu-kun! What&#39;s the matter? Did you have business in the second-year classroom?\n\nY-Yuuki-dono!? Hold on, I was spotted almost immediately…!?\n\nAh, could it be that? You were training to walk without detection?\nWell, there’s no wonder you’ve become a bit of a celebrity around here. I heard people say there’s a kid training as a ninja in our school, y’see~♪\n\nHuh!? D-Do I really stand out that much?\n\nMhm, mhm. There aren&#39;t many kids who aspire to be ninjas, much less train like one.\n\nEeep, spare me~! I&#39;m not doing this to stand out at all… Or rather, I don&#39;t want to stand out!\n\nIs that so? See, I was thinking of proposing a segment like “Blitz☆Yumenosaki Academy&#39;s Celebrities” for the next noon broadcast.\nSo I was hoping to ask you if you wanted to do an interview as well, y’know?\n\nI-If that happens, I&#39;ll definitely disappear off the face of the earth for a while?\n\nwith Mao\n\n    Location: Hallway\n\n\nIsara-dono~☆ Look, look, the shuriken I ordered online came in!\nWhen I saw they ran out, I came to terms with it and abandoned all hope — But when I checked the site just the other day, it was back in stock!\nI used up my allowance on it because I had to get it right away.\nThanks to that, I’ll have to rely on hyorogan to make it through the month, but… I have no regrets! If anything, getting to see the real thing puts my excitement through the roof~♪\n\nAh, yeah, I get that you’re thrilled, but could I ask you to get off my stomach?\nThe pressure’s been hurting for a while. You jumped on me so suddenly, so I wasn’t able to brace myself.\n\nUwaa, are you hurt? I was so happy to get my shuriken and see Isara-dono, I lost my composure.\n\nThat sort of trait isn’t very ninja-like, is it? Anyway, don’t you always have a shuriken on you?\n\nMy rubber shuriken? Of course, I have tons of them~\nThis time, I ordered a replica of a shuriken said to have been used by Hattori Hanzo.\n\nWhat? That sounds a little shady… Are you okay, Sengoku? You’re not being swindled, are you?\n\nAhaha, I’m alright. If it said it were real, even I’d know it was a scam.\nI’ll love anything that has to do with ninjas, replica or not~♪\n\nwith Midori\n\n    Location: In Front of the Lecture Hall\n\n\nMidori-kuu~n! I found what you were looking for! Just to be sure, could you check that it’s the right one?\n\nYeah… I’m sure this is the one… Thanks for helping me out, Sengoku-kun…\n\nNo need to thank me, it was a help to me that you gave me this mission.\nThere was nothing to do for RYUSEITAI today, so frankly my schedule was pretty open…\nFinding things is my specialty. If you ever need my help again, call out for me without hesitation~♪\nBut, what kind of basketball practice were you having that sent the basketball flying all the way to a place like this?\n\nThat’s what I’d like to know... I was told that we’d have practice at the basketball court today, so I came over knowing it was gonna be a pain…\nThen Morisawa-senpai said that he launched the basketball or something…? This isn’t soccer, for crying out loud…\n\nAhaha… At any rate, I’m glad we found it.\n… Hm? Isara-dono’s messaging me? Heheh, it seems I’ve been given another mission to carry out!\nExcuse me, but I have to take my leave now! See you tomorrow, Midori-kun!\n\nwith Nazuna\n\n    Location: Tennis Courts\n\n\nThere~...♪ Like~ that...♪\nOh, Nito-dono? By any chance, is the tennis club in the middle of practice?\n\nGhh?! Shinobun, don’t come into the tennis court outta nowhere. I almost hit you with the ball by mistake.\n\nM-My apologies! When I saw Nito-dono, I just couldn’t help but barge in!\nI seem to be in your way, so I’ll make my exit.\n\nNah, I’m just practicing on my own, so you’re not bothering me. Anyway, what were you up to, Shinobun?\n\nI was looking around for a good ninja spot. If you find a place like that, please let me know~♪\n\nAhaha, a “ninja spot”? Mm, got it. I’ll contact you when I do, Shinobun.\n\nThank you~! I don’t know if you would consider this repayment, but… If you ever need a ninja, please seek me out~♪\nMnn…~ Is it fine if I don’t need a ninja? I feel lonely practicing alone, so if it’s okay, I&#39;d like you to keep me company.\n\nOf course, as long as it&#39;s okay that it’s me! The Ninja Association conducts solitary activities too, so I don’t have much to do at the moment.\nEhehe, it looks like we&#39;ll have fun doing club activities today~♪\n\nwith Yuuta\n\n    Location: 1-B Classroom\n\n\nLet’s see, we’ve got class duty together today, right? Thanks for having me, Sengoku-kun~♪\n\nA-And to you as well\n\nAhaha, we’re classmates, so you don’t have to be so nervous~\n\nFweh? Err, umm…~?\n\nWell, I’m gonna write in the daily log, so could you erase the blackboard?\n\nY-Yessir! I&#39;ll make it quick~!\n(Uuu~…  I’m making Aoi-kun worry about me. I’m sorry for being so shy.)\n(At any rate, I must get the job done properly! I&#39;ll clean the blackboard and make it as good as new!)\nTake that! And thaaaaaat… ouch?!\n\nA-Are you okay? You’re not hurt, are you?\n\nDon’t worry! I just slipped and fell! I’d rather you focus on the daily log, Aoi-kun!\n\nYou say that, but hearing someone go “Take that!” is gonna concern me whether you mean to or not.\nMm, I know a way to erase the board without having to jump around. If you’d like, I can show you how?\n\nEh? But wouldn’t it be a bother…?\n\nWe&#39;re on the same class duty shift, so we’ll finish up faster if we help each other out. You’re not gonna be a bother at all\n\nAoi-kun… W-Well then, please do. Ehehe, I&#39;m glad that Aoi-kun’s on duty with me today~♪\n\nwith Souma\n\n    Location: Garden Space\n\n\nTake that…☆\n\nHm…? Is that you there, Sengoku? Are you playing around with a bug net?\n\nOh, Kanzaki-dono! I wouldn’t call it playing around! I’m in the midst of catching frog food!\n\nI see, come to think of it, you look after frogs, don’t you?\n\nIndeed I do! I&#39;m glad that you remember what I said before~♪1\nMomocchi and Thunder require lots of food every day, so today’s yet another day I&#39;m busy catching insects.\n\nIs that so? If that’s the case, I’ll help you.\n\nEh, are you sure? You’d be seriously saving me~!\nAfter all, you can hone in on moving objects so well that you can even catch flies with chopsticks!\nI bet you can catch tons of insects, even with the butterfly net, Kanzaki-dono~!\n\nHeheh, you have such sparkling eyes. That expectation for me makes me happy, and it urges me to respond in full.\nMm… Sengoku, stay still… Take that!\n\nOh! There are bugs in the net!\nNo way, that’s amazing! I didn&#39;t even realize there was a bug on my head!\nAs expected of Kanzaki-dono, you’re seriously the coolest ever…☆\n\nI feel quite bashful being praised so earnestly like that. Sengoku, do you still need more insects?\n\nYes, I want to catch lots and lots! If you have the time, I’d like your assistance just a little longer, Kanzaki-dono~!\n\nI don’t have any particular matter to attend to after this, so I’ll keep you company until you’re satisfied.\n\nWow, I'm so grateful~!

I-I’m… I’m okay.\n\nB-But… I didn’t land… (Hiccup)… I fell right into a puddle… Uuu… I’m all covered in mud and filth…\n(Hiccup)... I… Uuu… I’m a failure, (hiccup), as a ninja… Uuu…\n\nUwaaAAAAAAAA…!!\n\n(Hiccup)... I just w-wanted to impress you...\nBut I jumped off the roof… Uuu… and m-messed up the landing, then slipped into a puddle… Uuu… and even fell over…\nAnd Transfer Student-dono saw the whole thing… It’s so embarrassing, I want to die…\n\n\nBecoming a ninja was impossible from the start... (Hiccup)... and yet I&#39;m still giving it my all to become one...\nI always fail, and I never learn, so I got what was coming to me... (Hiccup)... I&#39;m not going to be a ninja anymore.... Ninjas... N-... Ninjas...\nI hate them...\n………\n\nNo, I could never do that–!! There’s no way I could ever hate ninjas!!\nNo matter how many times I fail, I’ve always wanted to become a ninja since I was a child!\nEven if Transfer Student-dono looks at me coldly, I can’t just completely give up~\n\n…! Transfer Student-dono, you’ll recognize me as a ninja!?\n\nJust hearing that has revived my spirit! I’m indebted to you, Transfer Student-dono~!\n\nChapter 2\n\n    Location: Classroom 2A\n\n\nTransfer Student-dono, are you here~?\nOhh, Transfer Student-dono. It’s good that I found you before you left the classroom~\nTo tell you the truth, I wanted you to accompany me for ninja training, so I came to ask you if that was alright.\nAs expected of Transfer Student-dono! I just knew you would accompany my pursuit of knowledge…!!\nWell then, please follow after me~♪\n\n\n    Location: Rooftop\n\n\n…! Transfer Student-dono, we’re so lucky~♪ No one’s here~\n\nThis time of day, a lot of units practice on the roof, and it’s difficult to ask people to hand over their spot for the purposes of “ninja-training”.\n\nSo I always train hard on the edge of the sports grounds instead.\n\nBut because the Archangel known as Transfer Student-dono is here with me today,  fortune has come my way, too~\n\nAh, don’t retreat as if you’re saying,  “Don’t call me Archangel”! Come baaack~!\n\nA-Anyway, what I mean to say is, with a  powerful ally such as you, Transfer Student-dono, I won’t face defeat!\n\nI’ll become a splendid ninja and make sure the association gets more members~!!\nHm? Transfer Student-dono. You seem to have a curious look on your face, did you want to ask me something?\n\nAh, you want to know the reason why I don’t practice in a classroom, but outdoors instead… Erm, that would be because there aren’t enough club members, so I’m not able to reserve a room.\nIf I could get the Association promoted to club-status, then I could use a clubroom to my heart’s content for ninja training, but…\nFirst off, I’d have to gather enough members, but even if I were to manage that, I was told by the teachers that I need at least a year of club activities2 before I’m able to get it promoted…\n\nThe Ninja Association that I established hasn’t been active for a full year, and on top of that, there aren’t enough members.\nSo my goal is to gain more members before I graduate, raise its status from an association to a club, and then accomplish my plan to transform the student body into ninjas!\n\nAs the first step, I’d like for Transfer Student-dono to be enlisted as a member of the Ninja Association…\n\nHuh, Transfer Student-dono? Transfer Student-dono–?\nThat&#39;s strange. She was just right in front of me... Ah, there you were, Transfer Student-dono.\n\n…!? Don’t run away! Your face says “I can’t take this any longer”... Don’t leave me~!\nI promise I won&#39;t try to recruit you again, Transfer Student-dono! So, please, come with me to my training! That&#39;s all I ask! I&#39;m begging you...!\n\nOhh, you&#39;ll come!? I&#39;m overjoyed with gratitude~!\nWell then, Transfer Student-dono, here I go~♪\n\nShutatatata… Shutatatata…\nLeg strength and jumping power are absolutely essential for a ninja. Training your leg strength like this is the first step on the path to becoming a ninja~\nNot just that, but completely erasing the sound of your footsteps is crucial for ninjas.\nIt doesn’t matter how fast you run — If the enemy picks up on your footsteps, you’re done for.\nWhat do you think, Transfer Student-dono? Am I managing to properly dash across the field like the breeze?\n\nIf there’s anything wrong, point it out, even if it’s just the teeniest bit off-point~\nEh? You can’t tell whether my footsteps are making a sound because I&#39;m talking while running?\n\nWhat! I made such a rudimentary mistake… What a critical blunder of a lifetime!\nUnderstood. I’ll try running without talking~\n\nShutatatata… Shutatatata…\nTransfer Student-dono, how about that!? Ahh, “shutatatata&quot; is my catchphrase when I run!\n\nTry to run without saying “shutatatata”? Th-That’s going to be difficult, but for the sake of becoming a ninja, I’ll do my best~!\n\n\n    Location: Rooftop (Nighttime)\n\n\n……\n(Huff… huff…)\nThe sun’s already set, it&#39;s pitch black outside...\nTransfer Student-dono! I&#39;m so sorry for keeping you out this late!\n\nBut it made me happy that you came along.\nDespite what you say, you’ve been the only person who’s accompanied me in my ninja training in the end.\n\nEveryone would just watch from afar — The only person who lent a hand was you.\n\n… Transfer Student-dono. Thank you for coming with me to my training.\nEven after the incident in the morning, you encouraged me, and it helped me come to my senses.\n\nI’ll keep your words in my heart as I continue my ninja training!\nWhen I’m able to call myself a ninja with pride, that’s when I’ll be able to show off my magnificent ninjutsu skills for sure~!\n\n\nSo please wait until then. If you’re willing to wait for me, Transfer Student-dono, I can endure the harsh training.\nBecause to me, Transfer Student-dono is a producer and Archangel-dono~♪\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Said in English.↑ He ends up conducting Ninja Association activities in Scroll of the Elements, Chuunibyou, and Dead End Land."},{"title":"Onigashima","url":"/translation//onigashima/","content":"\n\n    .preview-wrapper { /* in case jquery doesn't work */\n        display: none;\n    }\n    @media (max-width: 567px) { /* for NexT Mashiro: makes padding smaller on mobile */\n        .post-block {\n            padding: 5px 10px 8px !important;\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                Onigashima\n                鬼ヶ島\n                \n                    Start Reading\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    When Tetora shows up to the dojo late for after-school training, he gets the shock of his life when he hears Kuro utter “There’s nothing left to do but dispose of ‘em”...\n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Season\n                        \n                        \n                            Winter\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Chapters\n                        \n                        \n                            8\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Writer\n                        \n                        \n                            Nishioka Maiko\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Characters\n                        \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Translators\n                        \n                        \n                            citrinesea\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Proofreaders\n                        \n                        \n                            310mc\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Extra Information\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                Scout\n                            \n                            \n                                Scout!

1\n\n    Season: Winter\n\n\n    Location: Dojo\n\n\n Hm? The dojo’s empty. That guy Tetsu didn’t come yet?\n(And I’m just gonna… bow in front of altar.)\nAlright, I’ll start ahead of him. If I start practicin’, Tetsu’ll be here before I know it.\n… Ha! There! Ha! Take that!1\n… It’s no good. My thoughts are distracting me from doin’ the proper kata forms…\nI thought my head would clear out if I got my body movin’, but I’m still stuck in a rut. I just can’t get into practice like this.\nI’m settin’ a bad example doin’ somethin’ this, aren’t I?\n(Tellin’ anyone else about it is tough, though… At the end of the day, I gotta do somethin’ about it myself.)\n…… But. I keep havin’ second thoughts, or like… I feel at a loss, I guess.\nHow fuckin’ pathetic, get a grip. There are guys who look up to me ‘n put their hopes on me.\nAhh… It’s not in my nature to worry this much about things……\n\n\n(Cleanin’ took so long, I’m super late~! Taishou’s2 probably practicing already?)\n(Even though just about all the third-years retired from club activities already, Taishou shows up for the sake of passin’ on the club.)\n(Thanks to that, I get to work on throwing and grappling3 with Taishou!)\n(Don’t get me wrong, it&#39;s fun to do that with other club members too, but Taishou’s in a league of his own, so wrestling with him is the most fun!)\n(Recently, he’s been having grappling matches with me more than he used to. Guess it means I’m bein’ recognized by Taishou~♪)\n(Alright! Let&#39;s get fired up and do our best today too! I won&#39;t say I’ll get a win, but at the very least I wanna be able to get some points.)\n\nThere! Ha!\n\n(Ahh, it sounds like Taishou’s gotten a headstart on practice~ I can feel his fighting spirit eminatin’ from the dojo!)\n(Heheh~♪ Am I allowed to play a little prank on Taishou and surprise him~? Like makin’ a loud noise or something?)\n\n(Will he get angry? But I barely ever see Taishou get surprised, so I kinda wanna see it.)\n(Lemme juuust take a peek inside and scope it out…)\n\n\n(Ah, he really is practicing right now. … Hm? Taishou’s movements are kinda slower than usual today……?)\n\n…… Guess it’s like I thought. There’s nothing left to do but dispose of ‘em.\n\n...!?\n(Eh? Ehhh…!? Was that seriously Taishou who said that just now!?)\n(Dispose? Who will dispose who…!? Erm, it’s Taishou sayin’ it, so that means he’s gonna get rid of someone, right?)\n(No, no, no, no…… There&#39;s no way Taishou would say something so disturbing! I musta heard it wrong!)\n(Ahaha. It’s just like me to jump to the wrong conclusion~ To be a man among men, you gotta take it slow and steady.)\n(Just take a deep breath and compose yourself… In… out…)\n(Ossu, I calmed down a lot~)\n(Let’s check again. Taking another peek insiiiide…)\n\nAll I wanted was to just let this go, but if things keep goin’ this way, the people I cherish are gonna get hurt.\nThere’s nothin’ else I can do about it at this point. Next time I meet up with those guys, it’s time for them to pay up!\n\n...!?\n(UwaaAAAAA!! I definitely didn’t mishear him!)\n(He clearly said it&#39;s time for them to pay up! This time, I listened real carefully with my ears!)\n(What does he mean by that!? I-Is it possible that Taishou’s really planning to settle his scores with someone…)\n(Ummm, ummm~? Wh-What should I do!? Stop him!? Support him!?)\n(No, think rationally, I can’t support him doing that!? Aaah, I&#39;m getting more and more confused, I can&#39;t handle this all by myself…!?)\n(Ah, that’s it. Hasumi-senpai! If I just consult Hasumi-senpai……!)\n(At this time of day, he should be in the student council room. Right, I gotta head there quickly!)\n(Taishou! Don’t be too hasty yet~!)\n\nIt feels like there’s been some rustlin’ goin’ on outside for a while now…? Maybe Tetsu came?\nOi, Tetsu. Why aren’t you comin’ in… Wait, no one’s here. Was I imagining things?\nHm? Isn’t this Tetsu’s bag? Did he come here after all? Why’d he drop his bag here, then…?\n\n\n    Location: Student Council Room\n\n\nHasumi-dono4 , how about you take a small break? Haven’t you been working nonstop?\n\nHm? Ahh, so much time has passed already…? Don’t worry. Thanks to your help, Kanzaki, I’m at a stopping point.\n\nIs that right? I’m glad to hear that!\nBy the way, may I ask why you were doing student council work, Hasumi-dono?\nYou were working when I came, so I offered to help in spite of myself, but… Haven’t you already passed on the work to the other members?\n\nThe main things have been finished and passed on, but I’m just so used to this work after doing it for so long. I feel uneasy when I have nothing to do.\nThat&#39;s why I thought I&#39;d do an after-action report on Chocolat Fes5 from the other day, but… it seems I just got absorbed in it.\nRather, Kanzaki. Why did you also come here to help me as you always do in the first place?\n\nMe? Erm… Now that you mention it…\nI’m also the type to get uneasy when I have nothing to do, so I rushed in to help you as I usually do, Hasumi-dono!\n\nI have issues with moderation, but you’re just as bad, huh? We’ve reached a stopping point, so maybe it’s time for some tea or something.\n\nIf that’s the case, I will brew it! I would like Hasumi-dono to take it easy…♪\n\nSorry to make you do this.\n\n……—npa~i!\n\nHm? It sounded like someone just called for me? The hallway is noisy, isn’t it?\n\nAh, now that you mention it… Aren’t those footsteps?\nIt seems they’re coming towards this room at a tremendous pace!?\n\nHasumi-senpai! S-Something terrible is happening~!\n\nOnigashima Chapter 2\n\n(Gulping, gulping) …… Whew~! My nerves finally settled down! Thanks for the tea, Kanzaki-senpai!\n\nMhm, it was my pleasure to serve it. I’m glad I was brewing tea at the right moment.\n\nYou’re utterly hopeless! I don’t know what happened, but who in their right mind would just tear down the halls like that!?\nThe student council routinely cracks down on such an offense, you know! If people heard that someone had run into the student council room, we would be utterly humiliated!\n\nI-I’m so sorry! I was so panicked and got carried away…!\n\n… Well? What business do you have that warrants you coming here so breathless?\n\nAh! It&#39;s the terrible thing I was talking about! I came to ask Hasumi-senpai for advice— and the fact that Kanzaki-senpai’s here too is just my luck!\nSee, when I went for my club activities, I noticed that Taishou had gotten to the dojo earlier than me. Then I happened to overhear him talkin’ to himself about some real disturbing things…\nStuff like “There’s nothing left to do but dispose of ‘em” and “It’s time for them to pay up”......\nThat&#39;s why I thought maybe Taishou was planning on having them pay a “little visit” to the maker6... What the heck do you think I should do?\n\nKiryu said that? That’s ridiculous. There&#39;s no way that&#39;s the case with him.\n\nReally? I don’t think it&#39;s out of the question that Kiryu-dono would do something like that, though.\nI wonder what kind of wish came true for Kiryu-dono? As expected of a warrior, he never forgets to be grateful to the gods and Buddha!\n\nHuh…? Gods and Buddha…?\n\n… Kanzaki. The “maker” Nagumo’s talking about isn’t what you’re thinking of.\nThat saying is used to mean that someone intends to “retaliate”.\n\nWhat!? Retaliate…? Kiryu-dono would never do something like that! Are you trying to make light of Kiryu-dono’s nature, Nagumo!?\n\nN-No, that’s not it! I don&#39;t think Taishou would do something like that either!\nBut I heard what I heard… At first I thought I heard it wrong, but when I checked again, I heard him say something disturbing again…\n\nCalm down, both of you. I don’t think Kiryu would do that either… but I hardly think Nagumo is one to lie either.\n\nThat’s… That’s true, but……\n\nI swear I&#39;m not lying! A man among men would never do that. Hasumi-senpai, Kanzaki-senpai, please believe me!\nPoint is, after I heard all’a that, I freaked out and didn’t know what to do…\nThat’s when it came to me to ask Hasumi-senpai, so that’s why I hurried to the student council room.\n\nHm…\n(I certainly don&#39;t think Kiryu would do something like that...)\n(But Nagumo&#39;s acting like this. I don’t think it’s a misunderstanding, it&#39;s probably true that he heard it…..)\n(What on earth could this mean...? Is Kiryu really going to…?)\n\nWe will not be able to come to an agreement with our thoughts in distress! This situation calls for an emergency strategy meeting to be held!\n\n… Hah? An emergency strategy meeting…?\n\nThis feels like something RYUSEITAI would usually do, but I agree! I want some kinda strategy to get to the bottom of this!\n\nYes. Well said, Nagumo! With that settled, let’s write the topic of discussion on this “waito-boodo”!7\n“Regarding Kiryu-dono’s mysterious behavior… What should we do?”\n\nO-Oi. Don&#39;t proceed with the conversation as you please…\n\nI&#39;m not really good at usin’ my head, but I’ll think a whole bunch for Taishou’s sake~\n\nCome now, Hasumi-dono, you too! We want you to guide us as our consultant! I want all of us to come up with a plan together!\n\n………\n\nAt any rate, I think we should start by sorting out the situation!\n\n  U~myu. What I said earlier was almost all of what happened, but…\nUmm. When I went to club activities, Taishou was there practicing first. I wanted to spook him a little, so I quietly scoped it out.\nThen Taishou said, “Guess it’s like I thought. There’s nothing left to do but dispose of ‘em.”...\nAt first I thought I musta heard it wrong, so I peeked in again and he said, “Next time I meet up with those guys, it’s time for them to pay up.”\nThat&#39;s when I came here in such a hurry...\nWait, ahhh—!? I was in such a hurry that I left my bag outside the dojo. Well, it only has my textbooks in it…\n\nTextbooks are the most important thing you could have, for goodness’ sake…. Just what do you think your duty is as a student?\nIn any case, hmm… No matter how many times I hear it, I still can&#39;t connect it to Kiryu. Many things may have happened in the past, but I can’t imagine him doing anything like that in the current day.\nBut… that&#39;s right. At times like this, it&#39;s a matter of reversing logic.\n\nReversing logic… In other words, under what scenario would Kiryu-dono need to take such action?\n\nUnder what scenario…? Ah! Now that you mention it! That&#39;s what Taishou said! “If things keep goin’ this way, the people I cherish are gonna get hurt.”\nMaybe Taishou’s trying to get the jump on them to protect someone...!\n\nWhy didn&#39;t you lead with that!?\n\nHeheh, sorry. The horror was so strong from all the horrible things Taishou was saying, I totally forgot about it.\n\nWell, then that&#39;s the reason. If that&#39;s the case, it makes sense that Kiryu would try to make a move. I suppose this is him trying to protect us or someone else at the academy.\nBut I&#39;m sure he thinks it’ll cause us trouble, so he’s worrying about this all by himself…\nWill he ever do something about that side of his? How completely hopeless.\n\nOnigashima Chapter 3\n\nHowever, trouble is out of the question at a time like this, even if he has a good reason for it, like protecting someone.\nI can&#39;t let that guy&#39;s efforts go to waste in the end. I’ll keep that from happening no matter the cost.\n\nOssu! Of course!\n\nI’m in agreement too. However, while our aim is to stop it, we won’t be able to do much if we don’t know who he’s trying to attack, no?\n\nTo start with, since it seems like Taishou’s friends might get affected too, the enemy has to have a real deep grudge against him, right?\nIf that’s true, they should just pick a fight with Taishou and nobody else..\n\nIt’s possible that the opponent can&#39;t beat Kiryu with a direct attack, so they’re trying to use underhanded methods instead.\nWell, given the situation and how Kiryu was acting, it certainly seems like they have a strong grudge against him.\n\nTaishou is strong, after all. But they’ve gotta be someone holding a constant resentment for Taishou, right? Is there anyone like that around?\n\nA grudge… Kiryu is a reputable person, though, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone who would hold a grudge against him.\nA lot happened in this academy in the old days, but most of the people from that time have already left this school.\nNow, of the remaining students, there are probably more people who are grateful to Kiryu than not.\n\nYeah, I bet. That’s how I felt at the time of the Dragon King Competition!8 It made me think like, wow, everybody cherishes Taishou~\n\nHmph. At the time, I was extremely busy participating in another event, and the academy was empty too. I simply just didn&#39;t realize it was going on at the time.\nHad I known in advance, I would have definitely put a stop to it.\n\nMhm. There was suddenly a job to do at the time.\nBut, hmmm... If that&#39;s the case, could it perhaps be an old familiar face? Someone he knew before entering this academy……\n\nHmm... I’m not saying it isn’t possible, but I&#39;ve never seen him with someone like that.\n\nI don’t think so either. I see Taishou all the time, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him meet up with anyone like that before.\n\nAs I figured. I have no recollection of Kiryu-dono ever being with such a person as well.\nNo. If we keep speculating like this, we will never reach the truth! Why don’t we ask Kiryu-dono about all of this directly?\n\nDenied. If we do that and make Kiryu suspicious of us, it’s likely he’ll just lie to cover up the truth.\nAnd if Kiryu sneaks around about it, it’ll be even harder to pin down the other party.\n\nWhich means... Maybe watching over Taishou would be the best way of goin’ about it? Keepin’ an eye on him if he acts weird and stopping him if it seems like he’s gonna head to the other person?\n\n… I feel ashamed that I’d be monitoring my friend, but I suppose it’s the only way. You can’t solve a problem without making a sacrifice. Let’s go with that plan.\n\n\n    Location: Hallway\n\n\n(I&#39;ve been thinking about it since I heard Nagumo&#39;s story yesterday, but there really are still too many things that don’t make sense to me…...)\n(I don&#39;t think Kiryu’s that good at hiding things in the first place.)\n(If he was planning to do something like that, I’d think one of us would have noticed something was off.)\n(But, well, it&#39;s not like we’re always paying attention to things like that. It&#39;s possible that we missed it.)\n(At any rate, I won’t be as careless now, so if Kiryu does anything suspicious I’m sure I’ll notice it right away.)\n(I figured that I’d check in on Class 3-B every break between classes, but I didn’t see any signs of something being off with Kiryu… Maybe Nagumo&#39;s worries were unfounded after all?)\n(I do feel like we’ve been worrying about this too much, the more I think about it. I’m sure Kiryu’s just the same as always on this break too…)\n(Wh-What!? Kiryu’s not here…!?)\nWhere’d he go!? Did he really go to see that other person!?\nKh… I was careless! To think I’d lose sight of Kiryu in such a small span of time……!\n\nDidja need somethin’ from me, Hasumi-no-danna?9\n\nK-Kiryu! Wh-Where on earth did you…!?\n\nIt’s break time, so I thought it was a good time to go to the bathroom? Was it really that urgent? What’s up?\n\nEh!? N-No… That’s…\n\n……? What’s the matter? You’re speakin’ unusually stiff and sharp, danna. Is it somethin’ you can’t say here?\n\nNo, that’s not really… Erm, you see…\nC-... Could you lend me your textbook……? The, erm… mathematics one……\n\n…………\nHaha. Sure, gimme a sec.\n\n…………\n\nHere, you can take it with ya.\nHasumi-no-danna makes mistakes like that too, huh? Leavin’ stuff behind? Makes ya look like a real student, doesn’t it? Hahaha.\n\nGh… If you hadn&#39;t caused a fuss in the first place, I wouldn&#39;t need to tell such a lie…\n\nMn? What’d ya say?\n\n\nNothing! I’ll be borrowing this, just so you know! I appreciate it!\n\n…? Yeah, don’t worry about it.\n\nOnigashima Chapter 4\n\n    Location: Dojo\n\n\nHa! Like that! Ha!\n\n…… (Staring without blinking)\n\nThere! Hoo…! Ha!\n\n…… (Staring without blinking)\n\n… Kanzaki. I appreciate yer enthusiasm, but it’s seriously distractin’ that you’re sittin’ in seiza and starin’ at me at the edge of the dojo.\nIt doesn’t help that you’ve got an intense way about it. Somethin’ about that keeps making my eyes dart to you.\n\nPlease don’t mind my presence! Please think of me as a Jizo statue10 or something of the sort!\n\nThat’s quite a fierce presence for a Jizo… What is it? What’s with you suddenly wanting to watch my practice? Have you finally awoken to karate too, Kanzaki?\n\nNo, I&#39;m a samurai through and through, this sword cannot leave my side.\nI certainly think it&#39;s good to have a strong body that can fight without a sword, but no matter! It simply means I must never relinquish this sword at any given moment!\nIt&#39;s no exaggeration to say that this sword and I are one and the same!\n\nThen, why’re you watching me practice?\n\nUgh…! This is a mission of mine……\n\nMission? What d’ya mean?\n\nAh, no! As samurai, we have a family rule that requires us to train every day, so today, my training shall be learning through observation of Kiryu-dono&#39;s physical handling!\n\nIf that’s the case, shouldn’t we do somethin’ like kendo instead of karate? You’re a samurai, aren’t you?\n\nUghgh……\n(If I say anything more, I&#39;m going to let slip what we’re doing… If only Nagumo was here at a time like this...!)\nN-now that I think about it, is Nagumo not here? I haven&#39;t seen him around today. Will he be coming soon?\n\nDidja have business with Tetsu? Seems like he had a lesson with RYUSEITAI, so I don&#39;t think he’s comin’ here? If ya got business with Tetsu, why don’t ya let me pass on a message?\n\n(How could this be…!? I can’t believe he’s confined to unit practice today of all days… I can&#39;t call Nagumo for back-up on this.)\n\nKanzaki? What’s with the gloomy face? Did somethin’ happen with you and Tetsu?\n\nNo, it&#39;s not that I had any matter to do with Nagumo in particular. I just feel like I’d be saved if Nagumo were here…\n\nWhat d’ya mean, being saved? Were you guys that close…? Well, it&#39;s a good thing you and Tetsu are startin’ to get on good terms, though.\n\nRegardless, I would like to sit aside and watch Kiryu-dono train.\nOr is my being here a nuisance to you after all…?\n\nNo, you’re not gettin’ in the way or anything... Good grief, when ya get so modest out of nowhere, it makes me lose my bearings.\nI got it. No prob. Tetsu’s not comin’, but watch as much as ya like, Kanzaki.\n\nReally!?\n\nIt’s hard to do anything when you’re starin’ at me like you were a second ago, but……\nOh, I know. I’ll keep on practicing, so why dontcha practice some swordsmanship too? Do some practice swings or somethin’, the dojo’s nice and spacious. Let’s practice together~♪\n\nWhat!? Do you really mean it, Kiryu-dono, training with you…!?\nAh, no, but…\n(My mission is to watch over Kiryu-dono…)\n(Well, since we are together, I suppose I can fulfill my duty while I practice with him….?)\nMrm~…\n\nWhat’s wrong? You’re not in the mood?\nActually, I wanna know how to use a sword ‘cause of reasons. That&#39;s why I thought I&#39;d watch your swordsmanship, Kanzaki. Is it alright if I do or is it no-go?\n\nOh, wow! If that&#39;s the case, do let me be of help to you! Kiryu-dono, please watch to your heart’s content until you’ve had your fill~♪\nLet&#39;s get started right away, Kiryu-dono!\n\nOnigashima Chapter 5\n\n    Location: Dojo\n\n\n(U~myu… It&#39;s been a few days since our emergency strategy meeting, but Taishou hasn’t been doin’ anything suspicious.)\n(Hasumi–senpai and Kanzaki-senpai have been on the lookout for Taishou too, but he just seems the same as usual… Even in club activities, he&#39;s the same Taishou as always.)\n(I must’ve gotten the wrong idea after all…? That’d be relieving to know if that’s the case.)\n(Maybe I should ask Taishou straight up– somethin’ like, “Hey, what were you saying to yourself the other day?”)\n(And then he’ll burst out laughing outta nowhere and say somethin’ like “Ah, Tetsu, you misunderstood”...)\n(Huh, what’s that? Is that Taishou all the way over there?)\n\n......\n\n(Why’s he in a place like this? That’s behind the school building, right?)\n(He&#39;s holdin’ something long, but I can’t tell what it is…? And he’s even sneaking around avoidin’ people&#39;s attention.)\n(...This is way too suspicious~! I gotta catch up and follow him!)\n\n\n(I’m pretty sure Taishou headed this way… Ah, I found him!)\n\nErr… Kanzaki waved it around like this…\nHa!\n\n(Th-That long thing was a sword!? He’s finally got a weapon for when he–!?)\nAhh~!\n\nWhoa!? You surprised me!\n\n(C-Crap! He looked so prepared for a fight that I couldn&#39;t help but cry out!)\n\nTetsu? What’re you doing here?\n\nUmmm~? Ummm~...? I-I… I’m a little lost… on the… road called life……?\n…… Hah? Are you alright? You’re not runnin’ a temperature are ya, Tetsu?\n\nI&#39;m fine, there’s no need to worry about me! What are you doin’ in a place like this, Taishou!?\n\nM-Me? I was just… exercising, really…\n\nExercising… ? Why so suddenly, Taishou? You even got your hands on a sword!\n\nThis is, that… Apparently it&#39;s an exercise that’s been passed down in the Kanzaki family for generations.\n\n(I&#39;ve never heard of such an exercise! Also, you just hid your sword, didn’t you!?)\n\nWell, you don’t have to mind me either. I just wanted to get a lil’ workout goin’ is all.\n\nWorkout… Can’t you exercise to your heart’s content during club activities after classes are over?\n\nHuh? Ah… That’d be the actual match, though. What I’m doin’ right now is kinda like warm-up exercises for it.\n\n(Taishou, you&#39;ve been dodgin’ every question so far! No matter how you slice it, this is as shady as I thought!)\nTaishou! Um…!\n\nHm? What’s up?\n\n(I want to ask Taishou directly, but I made a promise to Hasumi-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai...)\n(If I ask here, Taishou will find out that we’re suspicious of him…..)\n\nTetsu…? Seriously, what’s wrong? You worried about somethin’?\n\n(Taishou… Isn’t Taishou the one with the worries? Why won’t he talk to any of us about it?)\n(Uu~uu! I absolutely won’t let you go give that guy payback!)\n…… Taishou! From now on, please stay with me!11 I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to stop you, Taishou! UUOOOOHH!!\n\nWhoa!? Don’t cling to me outta nowhere, Tetsu. You freaked me out.\nSo by that, you want me to stay at your place with ya? Is that what you were worried about?\n“Stay with me forever”... You want me to stay over with you ‘cuz yer lonely without your parents tonight? Is that it?\nHaha, I thought you were growin’ up, but you still say such kiddy things, dontcha?\nWhat happened? Didja watch a scary show on TV or somethin’? My lil’ sister sometimes watches ‘em too, and she sticks to me when she gets scared.\n\nUuu… I think there’s a huge misunderstandin’ here, but that works too... Just please, Taishou, stay with me!\n\nI’d love to stay by your side and everythin’, but not today, sorry. I’ve got somethin’ to do tomorrow, so maybe another time, Tetsu.\n\n(...! Taishou saying that means... M-Maybe tomorrow is the day he goes through with it…!?)\n\nOnigashima Chapter 6\n\n    Location: Shopping District\n\n\n(Yawning)\n\nWhat? Did you not get enough sleep, Nagumo?\n\nSorry. My mind wouldn’t stop racin’ about Taishou carrying out his plan today, so I didn’t get much sleep… (Yawn)\n\nI understand how you feel. I had a hard time falling asleep because my mind was racing over it too.\n\nOi, the reason we’re here is to stop Kiryu. Don&#39;t speak in a way that sounds like we intend to back him up.\n\nI’m aware! But who knows what will happen!\nBeing well prepared gives you no reason to worry. And today, my sword is in flawless shape far more than usual! I used some of my finer sword oil for the first time too~♪\n\nOi, Kanzaki. Could you not start being suspicious either? Kiryu’s causing me enough of a headache on his own.\nAt any rate, Nagumo, will Kiryu really pass through here?\n\nYesterday, I scoped out Taishou’s movements, so judging from that he should be here already!\nHonestly, I wanted to stake out Taishou’s house, but obviously I’d stick out too easily there.\n\nWell, I’d say that was a wise call. The best place to hide a tree is in the forest.\nAnd thankfully, today is a holiday. It’ll be harder for him to sense us shadowing him if there’s this much foot traffic.\nBut what will we do if Kiryu had actually noticed our plan and given us false information?\n\nI think we’re fine there!\nI called Taishou’s house a while back to find out what time he’d leave, and his little sister told me he’d already gone out!\n\nOh? You came thoroughly prepared. I thought you’d get flustered and not be able to do anything.\n\nOf course I did! This is the one day I can’t fail at any cost!\n\nBefore you get distracted by trivial talk, please look over there! Kiryu-dono has arrived!\n\nAh! Taishou! He’s holding something long today, too. I’m not really sure, but I think it&#39;s a sword. He was secretly practicing with a sword behind the school building yesterday, too.\n\nThat&#39;s certainly a sword bag. Now that I think about it, he said that he wanted to see my swordsmanship too……\n\nKiryu with a sword? He’s not Kanzaki, so what gives…?\n\nMaybe he’s up against something he can’t beat with only his bare hands? Like, maybe there’s so many people that he has to bring a weapon to stand a chance, or something like that…\n\nEven if that were the case, I think he’d probably fight with his bare hands to the very end.\n\nAh, both of you! Kiryu-dono is on the move! We have to follow after or we’ll lose sight of him!\n\nAhh—! Whatever the case might be, let’s go after Kiryu for now! If we follow him, it’ll tell us all we need to know.\n\nYeah!\n\n…………\n\nHmm. From what I can see of him, he seems the same as always, doesn’t he?\nIf he’s really going to fight someone soon, he’d look way more intense… Surely it can’t be a situation where he can simply act as always…?\n\nOh yeah, hmm…? I don&#39;t think I’d be able to do this trick, but Taishou’s powerful so he’s probably a master at erasin’ any signs of hostility before he gets into a fight, I think?\n\nIs that what it is? By all appearances, it just looks like he’s enjoying the shopping district, though…\n\nOh oh! Kiryu-dono is entering a store! That store’s… a “furawa-shoppu”?\n\nA flower shop…? He’s buying a lovely bouquet…? Oi, what’s going on? Everything about this is utterly strange, no matter how you look at it.\n\n…… Maybe it’s for a hospital visit?\n\nHah? Hospital visit…?\n\nWell, he’s gonna end up pummelin’ the person he’s about to fight. The least he can do is apologize…?\n\nI see. He puts his all even for the loser of a fight… I admire the depth of Kiryu-dono’s consideration!\n\nThat’s idiotic! Logically speaking, it’s clearly too out of place!\n\nAh! Taishou’s on the move again! Let’s just put this aside, we gotta go after him!\n\nRight you are, let’s move! Swiftly! Secretly! Vanishing into thin air!\n\nOi, wait you guys!\nHah… Can’t you compose yourselves even just a little?\n\nHuh? Taishou’s going into another store? This one looks like a stationery store, though.\nHe’s buying something again. This time it’s… origami paper? Seems he’s buyin’ quite a lotta it too.\n\nOrigami paper…? Just what does Kiryu plan to do with something like that?\n\nHa! I’ve got it! If the flowers from earlier were meant for a hospital visit, then this origami paper must be for a thousand-paper-crane chain!12\nIsn&#39;t that essential for a hospital visit?\n\nAhh, you’re right! Are there any limits to Taishou’s kindness!? He’s wishing the person he’s fighting a swift recovery!\n\n…… No, calm down, both of you. That can&#39;t be right. Something’s definitely off about this.\nIt doesn’t look like Kiryu’s on his way to beat someone up, and the things he’s buying along the way are completely unrelated to such an unsettling situation.\nBesides, at the end of this road…\nAh, I see. So that’s what it is.\n\n\n    Location: Residential Area\n\n\nEh!? Hasumi-senpai, did you happen to figure out where Taishou’s goin’? Everythin’ here is basically a residential area...\n\nYes. I can’t say I know why Kiryu is heading there, but I have an idea of what his destination is.\n\nWhat!? Really? Hasumi-dono! Where on earth is Kiryu-dono heading?\n\nYou don’t recognize this road too, Kanzaki? I think it’s a place you&#39;ve been to before.\n\nA place I’m familiar with? Oh oh, now that you mention it, I&#39;m sure that at the end of this road is—...\n\nOnigashima Chapter 7\n\n    Location: Residential Area\n\n\n…… What on earth does this mean…?\n\nKiryu&#39;s destination was there after all, huh?\n\nThis is the same kindergarten where we had a puppet show before.13\nHmm, judging from appearances, Kiryu-dono is playing with the kindergarteners… Moreover, Anzu-dono’s with him for some reason.\n\nUmmm, where’s he going for the payback visit? There&#39;s no way they&#39;d cause a scene in a place like this, so…?\n\nI’m guessing we had some kind of huge misunderstanding, most likely.\nHm? Kiryu’s noticed us.\n\nHasumi-no-danna…? And that’s Tetsu and Kanzaki too. What&#39;re you guys doing in a place like this?\n\nTaishou! Weren&#39;t you gonna get payback from someone today? Why are you playing with little kids?\n\nHah? Get payback? What d’ya mean?\nOh, lil’ miss. Tetsu and these guys came for some reason.\nMm? Ahh, yeah you’re right. There&#39;s no point standin’ around ‘n talkin’ in a place like this. You guys should come in. I gotta get ready soon too.\n\n…… Get ready?\n\n\n    Location: Kindergarten Classroom\n\n\nIt was my fault that we jumped to the wrong conclusion, I&#39;m so sorry!\n\nMmgh… I didn&#39;t realize it until the last second either, I’m so ashamed…\n\nSigh... I thought something was off half-way, but I never expected this to be the plot twist……\nLift your head, Nagumo. Kiryu was acting confusing from the get-go, so there’s blame to be had there too. I can see how you got the wrong idea.\nI never would’ve guessed that Kiryu&#39;s monologue was a line from his play about Momotaro.14\n\nSorry for misleadin’ ya, Tetsu. I didn’t think anyone would hear me sayin’ my lines.\n\nIn other words, to summarize what Kiryu told us...\nDue to the visit the other day, Nito got a request from the kindergarten for a play event.\nAnd you’re saying that you accepted the request because Nito and the broadcast committee members were too busy to accept it for themselves, Kiryu?\n\nYeah. I didn&#39;t wanna disappoint the kids, and that&#39;s not what Nito’d want either.\nBut unlike other large-scale external projects like DreamFes, somethin’ like this doesn&#39;t bring much value to the unit.\nIt felt awkward thinkin’ about involvin’ AKATSUKI and other units, so I took it on myself.\nAs long as the request was taken, Nito’s reputation would be fine.\nNito always does a lotta things for me, so I thought I’d repay ‘im a lil’.\nBut even though I accepted the offer, I’m not that good at actin’ to begin with. For whatever reason, I get kinda embarrassed when I practice out in the open.15\nSo I was secretly practicin’ the lines for my sword fightin’ scene, and Tetsu misunderstood me ‘cuz of it.\n\nYou’re beyond saving! If you had just talked to us about this, none of this would have ever happened.\nGood grief... I understand the gist of the situation, but why is Anzu here too?\n\nAhh. That it? Tetsu wasn’t the only one to see me practice my lines; lil’ miss saw me too. When I told her all about it, she offered to help me out. Right, miss?\n\nAh, I have no intention of blaming you, so don&#39;t apologize, Anzu.\nThis situation came from a comedy of errors. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anyone&#39;s fault.\n\nSo, today was the day of the event, and what we were tailing was Kiryu-dono buying souvenirs for the children along the way.\n\nAhh… But I&#39;m glad I was wrong~…\nAh! It’s not like I didn’t believe in you, Taishou! But, given the situation, I started to worry more and more.\n\nTo be fair, if someone was going to be harmed, you would be more than likely to take action.\nIn the first place, you always carry everything by yourself, and that’s how this misunderstanding happened. Reflect on that.\n\nHaha, you’re not wrong. Sorry for worryin’ you guys so much — Hasumi-no-danna, Tetsu, Kanzaki.\n\nHonestly, I’m just relieved that nothing happened.\nOh? It seems like the kindergarten teachers are calling Kiryu-dono for something?\n\nHm? You’re right. Is somethin’ the matter?\nAh, nah, these guys aren&#39;t members of the event. They’re more like my visitors…\nAh, that&#39;s right. It doesn’t change the fact I’m doin’ the whole play myself. I&#39;m plannin’ on having lil’ miss work on behind the scenes stuff.\n\nHm? Are there not enough people to do the play?\n\nIt’s just barely enough. I&#39;m Momotaro, and the rest of the roles are gonna be handled by the teachers.\nBut they gotta look after the kids too, so they don’t feel like they’ve got enough people around unless they do both jobs.\nWell, it might be a complete frenzy behind the scenes, but it&#39;ll work out somehow.\n\nYou’re the cause for this whole mess in the first place, and yet you’re back to acting distant with us and carrying the burden by yourself again!\nIt feels wrong to just let things stay like this! If that&#39;s how things are, we&#39;ll take part, too!\n\nOnigashima Chapter 8\n\n    Location: Kindergarten Classroom\n\n\nLil’ miss, are ya done cleanin’ yet? Ah, you did? When I was straightenin’ up all the backstage scene stuff you got left with basically everything… Sorry ‘bout that.\nThe play was a huge success, huh? I didn&#39;t think the kids would love it that much.\nDidja have fun too, lil’ miss? Yeah, that’s good. Danna ‘n the other two seemed happy to be surrounded by the kids too.\nMm? Ah, yeah you’re right. With how messy this turned out in the end, I shoulda done like you said and asked everyone for advice after all.\nThere’s not much reward to doing this, and while it wouldn’t be so bad if it were Nito’s Ra*bits, but AKATSUKI’s so far from this kinda audience, it felt hard to bring up.\nBut as ya said, those guys didn’t care about that kinda thing at all.\nI could act like I knew what I was doin’, and relax, while those guys helped me out and supported me.\nHaha. For sure. Maybe the kids loved the play so much ‘cuz the atmosphere was so relaxed from the get go.\nThe teachers really liked it too, so I finally felt good about it all.\nI’m real grateful they liked it, but I got real nervous when they said they wanted me to come back next month ‘n do it again.\nEh? Oi, oi. Gimme a break, lil’ miss. Even though things turned out this way, I still had no clue what the hell I was doin’, y’know? Though, of course I wasn’t plannin’ on just throwin’ in the towel midway.\nI was worried the kids would be disappointed if I was the one bein’ Momotaro. But, well, it seems they were pleased with it, so that was a relief.\n“Don’t say that”...? Haha, Lil’ miss scolded me.\nNah, I didn’t mean to make fun of you, I was just thinkin’ you said it in a way that’s similar to when my lil’ sister gets mad at me for somethin’.\nBy the way, what happened to the other guys?\nAhh, it’s afternoon nap time for all the kids? They’re helpin’ out with that, then.\nMm? Lil miss is gonna go ‘n help the teachers? I’ll help out too, then. I was under your care today, so lemme do this much for ya.\nDanna and the others are probably havin’ a harder time than you are…? Well, I guess so. There are a lot more people where they are.\nGotcha. I&#39;ll help Hasumi-no-danna’s group. I&#39;m sure it was the classroom next door, right?\n\n\nYo, Monkey-no-danna. Is there anythin’ I can help with?\n\nDon&#39;t call me by the name of my role. There&#39;s nothing I need your help with in particular. The kids are finally asleep, so please just be as quiet as you can.\n\nThey got put to bed already? Guess I came too late to help, huh.\n\nBut, how incorrigible. Couldn’t something have been done a bit more with the casting?\n\nHm? You mean about how Tetsu was the dog, Kanzaki was the ogre, and Danna was the monkey? I thought it fit you guys pretty well, though.\n\nIf it were just the monkey, I’d understand, but why did I have to play the pheasant as well?\n\nWe didn’t have enough hands, so it couldn’t be helped. Besides, for that role, your job was to do ventriloquism while holdin’ the pheasant doll.\nAnd you did a pretty fine job at that, Danna. Didn’t all the kids hound you for an encore afterwards?\n\nKh… it’s because I usually see that eccentric oddball’s tricks. It’s aggravating I got the hang of something as pointless as ventriloquism.\n\nTetsu and Kanzaki couldn’t do ventriloquism to that degree. They were just movin’ their lips like normal.\nHm? Come to think of it, what happened to Tetsu ‘n Kanzaki?\n\nIf you’re looking for the two of them, they were romping around with all the kids and making a racket. When the kids got put to bed, they fell asleep with them.\n\nZzz…… zzz……\n\n…………\n\nAhh, you’re right. They’re mixed in with all the kids that’re sleepin’, huh?\nI thought it was lil’ lonely that they were gettin’ all reliable on us, but seein’ ‘em like this, they’ve still got a bit of a kiddy part to them, huh?\n\nDon’t say that. You made the two of them worry about you so much that they said that they were too nervous to sleep properly. They probably felt relieved enough to relax now.\n\nWell, that was pretty bad on my part.\n\nAbsolutely. Reflect on yourself. Well, it was my fault too for not seeing through it….\nEven if I believed it was true, I wouldn’t have guessed that you were practicing lines for a kindergarten event.\n\nYeah, true.\nHey, if I really did go after someone like that ‘n beat them as payback, what would you have done, Hasumi-no-danna?\n\nHah? Where’d that come from so suddenly? You wouldn’t do something like that in the first place.\n\nI said what if. What if I did? I don’t plan to, but we don’t know the future, right?\nI was wonderin’ what you’d do about it if I really went to go ‘n beat someone down?\n\n…… I see. If that were the case, I’d give you a good wallop to stop you, even if it cost me my life.\n\n………… Hasumi-no-danna, doing that...? Like, to win a square-on fight with me?\n\nDidn’t I just say I’d do it even if it cost me my life?\n\nHahahaha. What, so you’re plannin’ on losin’? Come with a winnin’ attitude. You don’t sound sure of yourself at all.\n\nShut it. It’s a hypothetical, so it doesn’t matter if I win or lose. I know you wouldn’t do anything like that anyway.\n\nHaha. Hey, Hasumi-no-danna. I’m a lucky guy, aren’t I? I’m surrounded by all these good guys who care about me.\nI&#39;d love to show all&#39;a that to the old me. He’d be surprised for sure.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \nTranslation Notes\n↑ &quot;とりゃ！せいや!&quot; are more exclamations from martial arts like judo. They can be used when throwing something/someone heavy, or intimidating the opponent.↑ Tetora refers to Kuro as 大将 (taishou, lit. large general ), or boss.↑ More about uchikomi and kumite here.↑ -殿 (-dono) is an honorific that roughly means &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;. It's archaic, which gives Souma an old-timey feel.↑ AKATSUKI's Chocolat Fes story is Decorate. If you're curious about RYUSEITAI's it's Hot and Elegant Chocolat Fes.↑ Onigashima hinges around the phrase『お礼参り』する (lit. pay one's respects at a shrine). Colliqually, this refers to someone who's going to retaliate against someone else (i.e., someone who hasn't paid a loan). Souma thinks Tetora is using its original meaning.↑ In Japanese, words from other languages (such as English) are typically rendered in katakana. However, when Souma uses katakana words, they are all written in hiragana instead, likely to emphasize how he struggles with foreign words. These words are kept as written in hiragana, and put in &quot;quotes&quot;.↑ From the story Four Beasts of Fist Fighting. Keito's playing coy here because he was actually the one to divert attention away from the Dragon King Competition.↑ Kuro often refers to Keito as 旦那 (danna, lit. master ), or &quot;boss&quot;. He'll also use Hasumi-no-danna.↑ Statues of the Bodhisattva Jizo often dot along trails and sit innocuously, looking over wandering travelers.↑ Tetora is saying 止めて stay with me (stop, don't go) but Kuro thinks he's saying 泊めて stay (at my place) because they're both pronounced とまる.↑ Based on folklore, giving someone one thousand origami cranes is meant to wish them well or wish them long health.↑ This happened in The Wolf and Red Riding Hood with Kuro, Souma, Nazuna and Shinobu.↑ The story of Momotaro follows a boy who goes to Onigashima (lit. Ogre Island) to fight the ogres that live there. On the way, he befriends a talking dog, monkey and pheasant, who agree to help him in his quest.↑ If you wanna see Kuro's acting chops, read Tough Guy where he practices with Chiaki, Tetora and Midori."},{"title":"Many Minds, One Flower","url":"/translation//many_minds_one_flower/","content":"\n \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Writer\n                \n                \n                    Yuumasu\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Proofreading\n                \n                \n                    310mc\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    Season: Summer\n\n\n    Location: Starmony Dorm Commons\n\n\n (... I know that singing and dancing aren’t the only jobs an idol does, but I never thought I&#39;d have to perform an ikebana1 demonstration)\n(As Rhythm Link’s representative, I have to make sure I present something that doesn’t bring shame to the agency.)\n\n…… all done~♪\n\n Really? I haven’t even put together the main materials yet. Do you have experience in this, by any chance—-\n…… Shinkai. What is that?\n\nwhat do you mean? it’s [ikebana], of course. from the school of [shinkai]2……☆\n\n There’s no helping you. Don’t claim to be a school as you please. No matter how you look at it, all you did was stick a fish onto the needle bed.\nWe’re arranging flowers, not fish. This is beyond unacceptable. As STAR PRO’s representative, don’t you feel the least bit shameful?\n\nmmph… the only people who get to decide whether my [arrangement] is [acceptable] are the [beholders]. not you, [temple guy].☆\nis it [bad] if I don’t follow the [model]? if that’s the only way to get [recognized], that’s a little boring, isn’t it?\nanyway, I’ve grown tired of [ikebana], so i’m done here. i’m going to go [soak] in the [pond]……♪\n\n….. What an uninhibited guy. He does realize that this would make it a “coral arrangement”, not a “floral arrangement”, right?3\n(But Shinkai has a point. It’d be hard to say that it’s my work if I just stick to the textbook.)\n(However, you should only be creative and break the rules after you’ve learned them. If you take it on with your own style while you’re inexperienced, you’ll end up with a ridiculous work of art.)\n(Before anything else, I’ve got to thoroughly drill the basics in my head.)\n\n\n\n    One hour later\n\n(…… Hmm. This should be good enough for now.)\n(But it looks just like the picture in the textbook……)\n\nHello. Are you doing ikebana? What an unusual hobby~\n\nNot quite. I’m going to be participating in a flower-arranging demonstration. This is just practice.\n\nI see. And this is… a fish arrangement? Is this your work too, Keito-kun?\n\nThat would be Shinkai’s work. It stinks, as you’d expect from fish… It doesn’t look like he’ll be coming back either. I’ll have to go put this in the kitchen.\nThat&#39;s right. Aoba, if you don&#39;t mind, could you give me your thoughts on my work? I can&#39;t really judge it for myself.\n\nMy thoughts? Mmnnn~ I think it looks nice, but…\n\nDon’t hold back. I want your honest opinion.\n\nNo, it&#39;s not that I’m holding back. I just don&#39;t know much about ikebana. I know a lot about flower meanings, though.\nCould I try it too? I feel like I could evaluate your work properly if I try it myself.\n\nHmm. They do say that teaching is the best way to learn……\n\n(Sniff sniff)…  I thought it smelled like flowers here. It was you guys, huh?.\n\nAh, good afternoon. How about you join us, Ogami-kun?\n\nEhhh…?\n\n\n\n    Another hour later\n\n— And now for the arrangement. Place the flowers so that they fill in the gaps between the ones you just inserted.\n\nIn the gaps, got it~\n\nGaaaaah! I jumped in ‘cuz it looked interesting, but it’s taking forever! What a pain~!\nI mean, it&#39;s not rock ‘n roll to fit into the mold! I’m just gonna be me, like this, this ‘n — this!\nHow’s that, Hasumi-senpai! This looks way more like an UNDEAD flower stand now. Cool, dontcha think~♪\n\nFirst it was Shinkai, now it’s you… You’re truly hopeless…… We’re making flower arrangements, not flower stands.\n\nI&#39;m baaack. Hah~, I&#39;m tired……\nAoba-onii-chan, you’re holding something nice, huh. Gimme that rose~♪\n\nOf course, here you are.\n\nThank you. (Nibble nibble)…\n\n— Y-You ate it?!\n\nI didn’t eat it. I just wanted to get energy from the rose~4\nAre you all playing with flowers together? How peaceful...\n\nIt’s ikebana. Come to think of it, aren’t you also making an appearance on the show?\n\nMaking an appearance.... Ah, that variety show. I see, so that’s why you’re doing this.\nI don’t think they expect us to be proficient at it, so do we really need to practice?\nWe were invited to do our part as idols, so making the screen lively is enough, right?\nKei-chan, your stamina has its bounds, right? If you give anything and everything your all, one of these days you’re going to collapse.\n\nHmm. It’s a reasonable point.\nBut in order to leave a good mark, I intend to put my entire heart and soul into the task. Rhythm Link is already packed with top veterans, after all.\nI’ll perform well so they’ll ask me to return. This is just me laying the groundwork in order to break into semi-regular status.\n\nHmm…… Well, I guess I&#39;ll join you guys and have some fun with the flowers, too. You&#39;ll probably improve if you have a rival...\nAnd as NEW DI’s representative, I can&#39;t just stand by and watch…...♪\n\nHmph, do whatever you like. You&#39;re probably more of a natural at this sort of thing than I am, but...\nHard work will not betray me. I’ll have the last laugh.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \nTranslation Notes\n↑ Ikebana (生け花, lit. giving life to flowers) is the art of Japanese flower arrangement. Read about its principles and relationship with Buddhism here↑ Schools pass on the art of ikebana to students. Each individual school follows a particular set of principles, philosophies, and arranging techniques, all which vary depending on the school. Matching the name format of (school)-ryu (流), Kanata calls it 深海流 (School of Shinkai).↑ Originally, he says 生け花、生け魚 (flower arrangement, fish arrangement), but since it rhymed (hana, sakana), I wanted to preserve his pun.↑ A good reference for this is this Ritsu card from Fleur de Lis"},{"title":"Opera","url":"/translation//opera/","content":"\n\n    .preview-wrapper { /* in case jquery doesn't work */\n        display: none;\n    }\n    @media (max-width: 567px) { /* for NexT Mashiro: makes padding smaller on mobile */\n        .post-block {\n            padding: 5px 10px 8px !important;\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                Opera\n                歌劇\n                \n                    Start Reading\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    AKATSUKI is putting on an opera.

while looking at beautiful flowers in full bloom... It truly is the highest luxury.\nIt&#39;s so rare to have such sunny, good weather on a winter day like this. I feel like I&#39;m in good shape.\nHehe, I can&#39;t help but want to sing……\n(Cough, cough)\n\nEichi.... Why not enjoy the tea in moderation and go inside?\nYumenosaki Academy is built on a hill facing the ocean. Being exposed to the sea breeze must be harsh on your body.\nCan you stand? If you can&#39;t, I&#39;ll give you a ride on my shoulders! Come now, please don&#39;t hesitate~☆\n\nI wish you’d stop treating me like a child. I mean, I&#39;m the same height as you. If you carry me on your shoulders, won&#39;t you collapse?\n\n That might be so. If this were Himegimi, I could easily cuddle him in my arms, but carrying Eichi would likely be too difficult!\nWell, clowns make the impossible possible. There&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t do...☆\n\nI think “clowns” are meant to entertain people. Although in your case, Wataru, I think you’re more of a &quot;magician&quot; than a clown.\n\nMy selling point is my versatility! Please refer to me as both &quot;clown&quot; and &quot;magician”...♪\n\nGood grief, I never get bored when I talk to you, Wataru. It’s like having the fun of an amusement park in the palm of your hand~♪\n\n Oh? Have you ever been to an amusement park, Eichi? Fufufu, they’re like a wonderland...☆\nNo matter how old they are, adults can forget time and have fun like the children they used to be. That is what makes them a wonderland.\n\nOh? I think you and amusement parks are a perfect match, actually. Isn&#39;t it easy to entertain children with your jack-of-all-trades talent?\n\n Fufufu. You say delightful things, don’t you...☆\nSometimes strict, sometimes sweet. I can only sing my praises of your ability to juggle the carrot and stick so adeptly!\nPerhaps that’s why I can&#39;t leave His Majesty the Emperor’s side.\nCould it be that you even had the skills of a beast-tamer on hand in order to keep me in one place, Eichi?\n\n Were you a beast? A clown, a magician, and a beast on top of that. I’m impressed.\n… (Cough, cough)\n\n Oops, forgive me. I had so much fun chatting with you that your health slipped my mind.\nCome, Eichi. Please put an end to your happy dream and come back to reality...☆\n\n I’d rather you don’t treat me like I’m sick, but… (cough, cough)... I really haven&#39;t been able to stop coughing for a while now.\nI&#39;m going to go inside and warm up.\n…………\n\nWhat’s wrong, Eichi?\n\nMm, that person over there is Anzu-chan. She doesn’t seem to be feeling well. Maybe something happened?\n\nFufufu. Even though you’re the Emperor, you&#39;re still human. Or are you sweet on Anzu-san because she’s close to you?\n\n She did break down this school and rebuild it, after all. Well, I can&#39;t say it&#39;s a complete job, but she’s still coming along well.\nIs it that strange that such a presence weighs on my mind?\n\n No. Anzu-san is also the person who made love bloom in the unfeeling, dull Hokuto-kun.\nEven if it’s not to the extent as His Majesty the Emperor, Anzu-san intrigues me too…♪\n\n Anzu-chan’s also liked by an unexpected person now, hm? Is that another one of her talents?\nIn any case, we don&#39;t have the option of just leaving it be. Anzu-chan, would you like to come over here and have some tea with us?\n…Hmm, I guess she didn&#39;t hear me. At this rate, she’ll just keep on her path.\n\nIn that case, I&#39;ll stop her in her tracks! Just watch! Un, deux, trois...☆\n\nMy, what a clever idea to put roses out on the path to stop her. It’s because you can produce that many roses in an instant that I can’t help but think you can even use magic~♪\n\nIt’s the highest honor to receive such praise! Come, Anzu-san. Can you see me? You do now, good!\nWould you like some nice, warm tea? It&#39;s a hot drink that will fill you up and stave away the cold. … You bought tea from a vending machine?\nBut the weather is so cold, it sinks into your bones. There&#39;d be nothing worse to have than cold tea.\nWe have hot tea and scones laid out here~♪\nOh? The scones got a reaction out of you. Anzu-san, do you like clotted cream?\nIf so, let&#39;s add cream! Do you like jam? Then let’s add some jam, too!\nFufufu. It&#39;ll be a little tea party in no time! Come now, eat up~☆\n\n Oh dear, my job was taken away from me. Well, the tea that Wataru brews is quite delicious, so it&#39;s okay.\nWhew... It&#39;s so tasty it envelops all your senses. I’d like him to join the “Tea Club” with talent like that.\n\n Though I’m known to be versatile, I can&#39;t split myself to be in many places at once. Although, I suppose it&#39;s not impossible if you master it.\nIf it came down to it, I’d just have to set up a body double...☆\n\n I can never tell how serious you are. Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Anzu-chan.\nEven though I forced you to stop, it’s just me and Wataru speaking. That must be dull.\nIt looked like you were troubled about something, so I stopped you to speak with you.\nHeheh, are you holding back, by any chance? I heard that you asked Kiryu-kun from AKATSUKI to give you pointers on how to make costumes.\nI’m not saying to treat me like I’m Kiryu-kun, but I&#39;d be happy if you could open your heart to me a little, as well.\nThank you, Anzu-chan. Well then, could you tell me right away...?\n\nOpera Chapter 1\n\n    Season: Winter\n\n\n    Location: Garden Terrace\n\n\nHmm. Keito approved of your skills at Quarrel Festival1, and entrusted you with the planning and management of an upcoming S2 event.\nEven so, that Keito…\nHeheh, why are you shrinking away? Are you feeling self-conscious about Keito since he was so hard on you during Quarrel Festival?\nAm I wrong? If so, you should take it in stride. It means Keito recognizes your talent as a producer.\nOtherwise, he wouldn’t give you another project, even if it was an S2.\n\nAs expected of my fated rival…☆ The fact that he has his eyes on you speaks to his discerning eye!\nQuarrel Festival was so exciting, I couldn&#39;t believe it was B1.\nIf you’re the one producing the event this time too, students from all over school will come to see it...☆\n\nIf it were an S1, we could invite guests from outside the school. However, S2s – held once a month – can’t be expected to be as large as S1s.\nStill, since it&#39;s an official Dream Festival, it will be reflected in your grades, and it will also affect your activity funds.\nOops, I didn&#39;t mean to put pressure on you, Anzu-chan. I suppose I was being careless with my words.\nAt any rate, it&#39;s not bad to have Keito rely on you. It&#39;s actually a good trend.\nYou&#39;ve been planning and managing S1s up to now, so I think you&#39;ll do well this time, too.\nDon’t worry, you have talent. I’d like you to believe in yourself.\n\nFufufu, what a heartwarming sight...☆ But it’s time for me to ignore the atmosphere and cut in!\nEven if I’m left alone, I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to wiggle my way back in...☆\n\nIt’s just like you to go out of your way to state your intentions, Wataru. In any case, I have something to discuss with you.\n\nOh? About what? If His Majesty the Emperor asks for it, I would even go to the other side of the world~☆\n\nIt&#39;s not as big of a request as that. It’s about Anzu-chan. It seems she still has such a long face.\nI&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s something else that&#39;s troubling her.\n\nIf so, you simply need to ask her directly! Anzu-san, are you perhaps… troubled with something?\nOh, you&#39;re restless. It seems it’s something to do with what&#39;s in your bag.\nPerhaps there’s materials concerning AKATSUKI in it? Fufufu, your eyes keep darting around.\nAnzu-san’s trouble is that she was asked to produce AKATSUKI, but…\nYou’re thinking, “I don’t know what kind of performance I should do!” — is that what it is?\nOops, are you alright? I didn’t expect you to be surprised enough to nearly fall out of your chair...☆\n\nWhat’s with these leading questions? I’m impressed you were able to figure out her troubles through those hints alone.\n\nIf you have love, you can understand most things...☆\nNevertheless, a performance, is it? If you&#39;re looking for a program that’s typical of AKATSUKI, how about an opera? Maybe taking place around the latter half of the Meiji Era?2\n\nHehehe. She&#39;s clapping her hands with joy. Hm? If possible, you’d like to receive some acting guidance, too?\nIt&#39;s none other than Anzu-chan&#39;s request. Of course, I’ll listen...\n(Cough, cough)\n\nDon&#39;t push yourself too hard, Eichi. Although drinking tea warmed us up, it’s still this cold.\nWe had so much fun chatting that we ended up prolonging this peculiar tea party, but it&#39;s about time we wake up from our dream.\nNeither Eichi nor I can be acting instructors, but let&#39;s support Anzu-san as much as we can...☆\nFor example, maybe we could do something like… participate in the program Anzu-san comes up with?\nFufufu, the role you want us to play has already been decided, hm? Truly splendid!\n\nThe role of a houseboy?3 Mm. If that&#39;s the plan, even if I&#39;m not in good shape, I&#39;ll be able to perform until the end…~♪\n\nAm I the role of a Tsujigiri?4 It’s typically hard for me to get an opportunity to play the role of a villain like this.\nMore than anything, it seems fun, so of course I&#39;ll accept...☆\n\nKeito and I fought with all that we had at Quarrel Festival, but this time it&#39;ll be different. I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing what kind of drama it will be...♪\n\n\n    Location: Dojo\n\n\nOssu!5 Nagumo Tetora, coming in!\n\n…………\n\nTaishou!6 Nagumo Tetora, I’ve come in!!\n\n…………\n\nUwaaa, please don’t ignore me! It’s Nagumo Tetora, Taishou~?!\n\nHuh…? Ahh, Tetsu. Stop your stompin’ and c’mere. I need to check this costume size.\n\n\nOssu! I’ll do whatever you ask, Taichou! Er, like this?\n\n… There’s a little extra sleeve here. Tetsu, have you gotten shorter?\n\nEhh, are you serious!? But, when I took my measurements the other day, my height didn’t change…?\n\nTch. This is Kanzaki&#39;s costume. I mixed it up by accident since the colors were similar. This is your costume.\n\nOooh, it&#39;s Taishou’s new work! The costumes are super cool too!!\n\nThanks, Tetsu. Hearin’ that makes me wanna make more. Well, all’s left to do is finish this thing…—\n\nU-... Ummm~ Taishou?\n\nWhat? I&#39;m tryin’ to figure this out, so couldja leave it for later?\n\nNo, but it’ll be a problem if you drown in your passion for sewing forever! This is a dojo, a place to practice, Taishou~?\n\nIt&#39;s so noisy in the classroom that I can&#39;t really concentrate on sewing. Here, it&#39;s quiet.\nYou should mind your manners at the dojo, too. You’re restless when I take my eyes off you, so it&#39;s a pain to put together your costume.\n\nBut I don&#39;t think you should sew at the dojo in the first place!? Taishou~, you’re the captain of the karate club, not the handicraft club.\nIt&#39;s great that you like sewing, but when you’re in the dojo, I’d like you to do karate instead!\n\nTetsu... That&#39;s right. You&#39;re right.\n\nTaishou…!\n\nI can hang out with you as soon as I put the finishing touches on this costume, so just wait a little longer.\n\nA-... Alright~? It&#39;s true that it sucks to leave things unfinished. Ossu, Nagumo Tetora: I&#39;ll wait as long as you need!\n...Oh, Anzu-anego? Hee~eey! Are you here to watch us practice?\nAh, you’ve got business with Taishou, huh? But right now he can&#39;t take his hands off sewing, so please wait ‘til he’s done~\n\nOpera Chapter 2\n\n    Location: Dojo\n\n\nOh yeah, do you have something to talk about with Taishou, Anzu-anego?\nHmhm. The leader of AKATSUKI asked you to plan and manage an S2, huh? As expected of Anego!\nThe fact that Hasumi-senpai gives you the time of day, it’s so respectable~♪\nSo, what kinda performance is it gonna be? Er, is it a bad idea for a RYUSEITAI member to ask this...?\nYou decided on the theme of the program after asking your seniors at fine, so you don&#39;t mind...? I’m happy to hear it!\nHmhm. An opera taking place around the latter half of the Meiji era. That&#39;s such a typical act for AKATSUKI, I’m pumped~♪\nHuh, why do you look troubled? Did I say something weird...?\nIt was good that you decided on a performance, but then you realized there weren&#39;t enough people and panicked. Anzu-anego’s so scatterbrained~\nAh, I didn&#39;t mean to make fun of you. Taishou’s been absentminded like that too, so I felt a sense of familiarity!\n\n… Did you call for me, Tetsu?\n\nAh, Taishou. You finished sewing. Thanks for your hard work~♪\n\nSorry for making you wait. Well then, let&#39;s practice—... Lil’ Miss?\n\nSeems like she had something for you to do, Taishou. Since you were concentrating on sewing, I told Anego to wait ‘til you finished.\n\nLooks like I’ve caused trouble to both Tetsu and lil’ miss. So, Miss. What am I takin’ care of for you?\nAh. You decided on the program for the S2 Hasumi asked you for, so you came to let me know. Then, have you told Hasumi yet?\nIs that right? I guess you thought you’d tell me and then let him know, but maybe you’re telling the wrong person first...?\nHmm. Since I’ve been helpin’ you out with costume-making and physical training, my face was the first thing that popped into your head?\nHaha. You’re really good at flattery, huh. Good grief, I’m no match for her at all...♪\n\n\nOh, Taishou is smiling like he would at his little sister! This is super valuable~! Click click~☆\nHey, Tetsu. Using smartphones in the dojo is prohibited. Do you want me to confiscate it?\n\nO-Ossu! I&#39;ll be mindful next time! So please don’t take it from me~!!\n\nYou don’t need to apologize with a dogeza on top of that... C’mon, Tetsu. I&#39;m not angry anymore, so lift your head.\n\nUuu, Taishou is kind. I think I might fall in love with that kindness~♪\n\nErrr… what were we talking about?\n\nSo fast! You forgot so fast, Taishou!?7\n\nUhhhh... Ah, I remembered. It was about the S2. An opera is a performance typical for AKATSUKI, and I think Hasumi would approve of it.\nI was just trying to make military uniforms. Since AKATSUKI is a Japanese-style unit, I didn’t think we’d get to wear something that isn’t a kimono. Looks like we’ll get to use ‘em now.\n\n…………\n\nWhy do you keep glancing around, Tetsu? Do you needta piss?\n\nNo! Taishou, have you no sense of delicacy!?\n\nHaha, sorry. Yeah, Lil’ Miss is here, too. There&#39;s no way you can mention needing the toilet in front of the girl you admire.\n\nTh-That&#39;s not what I meant! I mean, yeah, Anzu-anego is my aspiration…? But, but! That&#39;s not what I wanna say right now…?\n\nIt’s not manly to be so restless like that. If you got somethin’ to say, just say it.\n\nO-Ossu!! (Breathe in, breathe out)...\nAnzu-anego, I wanna be in the opera, too...!!\n… You see, just before Anego transferred here… I wanted to join AKATSUKI, but I failed the exam. Even now, I get frustrated when I think back on that time.\nBut then, I was invited by Taichou to join RYUSEITAI... And at first, I was reluctant to participate properly, but...\nI’m really grateful to be a member of RYUSEITAI now, from the very bottom of my heart. So, I’ve got no complaints there.\nBut somewhere in my heart is the longing to work with Taishou, again.\nI still haven&#39;t become as manly as Taishou, but I&#39;d like to study him up close on stage.\nThat&#39;s why when I heard what Anego was saying, I figured this was my only chance. If I miss this, there might not be another one.\nPlease, Anego. Please let me be in the opera...!!\n\nCan I ask you for that favor, too?\n\nT-Taishou…?\n\nTetsu may be rough around the edges, but he has the qualities of an idol. More than anything, he and I are compatible.\nIt might be an irregular case, but if the members aren&#39;t decided yet, I&#39;d be glad if you could get Tetsu in the mix.\nAhh, thanks. But man, you accepted that favor so easily. I thought you&#39;d have more to say...?\nYou’re grateful for Tetsu&#39;s offer since you didn&#39;t have enough people to begin with?\nHis role… ... that&#39;s right. With Tetsu&#39;s personality, it’d be tough for him to play the role of Tsujigiri. Wouldn&#39;t a night watchman be more suitable for him?\nThe role of Tsujigiri is... Hibiki? I&#39;m sure he can deal with multiple people without issue, but it’d be good to have at least one more person if we can.\nI&#39;ll try to find a few people, but could you give it some thought, too, lil’ Miss?\n\nPardon me...!!\n\nChallenging the dojo is a feat of courage…–8 er, isn&#39;t that Morisawa? Don&#39;t enter in a misleading way.\n\nHa ha ha, sorry~☆ Anyway, is Nagumo here?\n\nTaichou’s always causing trouble, isn&#39;t he?\n\nOhh, Nagumo, have you been well? Today, I&#39;m shining with the brilliance of the sun in the sky again, fwahahahaha...☆\n\nMnn, I don&#39;t want people to think we&#39;re acquaintances... So, Taichou. Please tell me what you want without laughing so loud.\n\nMm. Nagumo…– no, Ryusei Black! Do you know what day it is? That&#39;s right, it&#39;s the day for RYUSEITAI’s activities...☆\n\nHuh? Isn&#39;t that tomorrow?\n\nOops, I should’ve realized that, huh? That was careless of me. But, it’s too late now, I’ve already come to pick you up!\n\nEhh~? I wanna do karate practice with Taishou. Plus, I wanna talk to Anego about the opera, too.\n\nAnego...? Ohh, Anzu’s with you, huh? Well aren’t you a smooth guy, you~♪\n\nUuu. Taishou’s attitude didn’t annoy me before, but it’s kinda irritating when it’s Taichou...\n\nHmm, is this also a matter of difference in core nature?9 Well, alright. What was this about an opera? Could you fill me in on it, too?\nDepending on the details, I might as well join in too, fwahahaha~☆\n\nOpera Chapter 3\n\n    Location: Dojo\n\n\nHmm. The more I hear about it, the more fun it seems! Alright! I&#39;ll join in too...☆\n\nEh!? Taichou’s gonna participate too!?\nWell, Anzu-anego told us there was a shortage of people, so she’d probably be happy if Taichou participated...?\n\nI see, I see… Anzu’s a good kid, huh~ There, there~♪ (Pat, pat)\n\nMorisawa, lil&#39; Miss&#39;s eyes are spinnin’. She’s a girl, so be gentle with her.\n\nOoh, forgive me for this! Lately, my juniors growing so well has resonated with me so much that I can&#39;t help but feel overwhelmed with emotion.\nBut, all kinds of people like you, Anzu. If you became the leader of any unit, there would be nothing to fear...☆\nOops, there&#39;s no point just standing around chatting. This is going to take some time to prepare, right?\nAt any rate, I&#39;ll join in too! As a night watchman...☆\n\nTaichou’s gonna be a night watchman too?\n\nMhm. Because I’m an “ally of justice”! Tsujigiri go against justice, so I don’t want to be one!\n\nIsn’t that pretty selfish of you~? But true, if Taichou were casted as Tsujigiri, it just wouldn’t feel right. He might be good as a watchman.\n\nMn? Ahh, that&#39;s right. Could you tell Hasumi about all this before lunch break ends?\nKanzaki should also be in the student council room around now. Right, I’m counting on ya, Lil’ Miss~♪\n\n\n    Location: Student Council Room\n\n\nKanzaki. Please put all of the outgoing documents in the box over there.\n\nUnderstood, leave it to me...♪ However, you work all day long, even during lunch breaks. Is your physical health alright, Hasumi-dono...?\n\nThis is always how it is. Besides, Eichi&#39;s health tends to deteriorate around this time of year. I don&#39;t want to force him to do too much.\n\nHasumi-dono’s so thoughtful of his friends~♪\nFor me personally, I can’t say that I don’t have my own thoughts about Tenshouin Eichi. After Tormenting Hasumi-dono, and pushing AKATSUKI to the brink of disbandment…\nHowever, that was a fight between Hasumi-dono and Tenshouin Eichi.\nIf by exchanging fists, you deepened your friendship, then there’s nothing more I can say about it~♪10\n\nThank you, Kanzaki. There, there~♪ (Pat, pat)\n\nH-Hasumi-dono. I&#39;m happy to be patted on the head, but I&#39;d appreciate it if you’d be a little more gentle with me!\nIt’s probably because you’re gripping my head, but I’m feeling dizzy!\n\nAhh, sorry. Maybe since I’ve been holding my pen so long, I couldn&#39;t adjust my strength properly.\n\nHow much force did you use to hold the pen!?\nAh, ow. Hasumi-dono, please stop already–\nAh, Anzu-dono! Did you sense my predicament and come to save me?\nNo, I can&#39;t ask for help from someone who’s no different from my lord, that’s absurd...!\nI&#39;ve been relying on Anzu-dono before, and I&#39;m relying on Anzu-dono again… I&#39;ll have no choice but to pay for this with my life! I will apologize through seppuku!11\n\nStop trying to solve everything with seppuku.\n\nB-But…! I can&#39;t think of any other way to make amends…!\n\nIf you keep saying “seppuku, seppuku”, I&#39;ll confiscate that sword, alright?\n\nI– I&#39;ll be a good boy! So my sword… just my sword...!! Uuuuuuaaa!\n\nI get it already, so don&#39;t cry. Here, use this handkerchief to wipe your face.\n\nUuu… hgh…\n\nHave you settled down?\n\nMm. I’m very sorry for losing my composure! Please rest assured that the “hankachi” I borrowed will be washed and returned.\n\nYou don&#39;t have to worry about it that much... More importantly, Anzu. What business do you have in the Student Council room? It&#39;s not like you came here for nothing, right?\nHmm. It’s about the S2?\n… Certainly, if that&#39;s what you’re going with, it’ll be appropriate for AKATSUKI. That’s impressive thinking, Anzu… There, there~♪\n\nOoh, Hasumi-dono is patting Anzu-dono on the head with a gentle smile! Since you also patted me, you must be in a good mood today, are you not..?\n\nI’m intrigued, however. An opera is an interesting thing to come up with.\n… What? Hibiki gave you the idea?\n………….\n\nH-Hasumi-dono! Anzu-dono is in pain!\n\n…… Forgive me. It seems that I lost my cool when I heard Hibiki&#39;s name. I see, so this is Hibiki’s...\n\nYou have a far-off look in your eyes, was it that shocking to hear...?\nThis is bad. I have to bring Hasumi-dono back to reality, somehow…!!\n\nEichi...? Anzu, you… did you say Eichi? Does that mean that Eichi is also involved in this matter?\nI see, Eichi will also be participating as a houseboy. If that’s his role, there won&#39;t be that many scenes. Eichi will probably have enough physical strength to make it to the end.\nHibiki… is playing the role of a Tsujigiri? I hate to say this as if I’m acknowledging him, but if it’s him, he could play any role.\n\nAs soon as Hasumi-dono heard Tenshouin-dono’s name, his eyes lit up. The power of friends truly is mighty...♪\n\nA first-year and a third-year from RYUSEITAI will also be participating as night watchmen? … I don&#39;t mean to complain, but that’s a lot of watchmen, isn’t it?\nI’m sure Hibiki could do the job on his own, but I&#39;d like to see at least one other person in the role of Tsujigiri.\nKiryu said the same thing as me? Hmm. So we had the same thought, huh. Let me think of someone from my side...\nWhat? Kiryu said that too? I don&#39;t mean to think that much like him…\nBut we both belong to the same unit. Maybe we’ve grown to have similar trains of thought.\nAnyway, I&#39;ll think about this as well, but “Opera” is a DreamFes that you’re to plan and run. In the end, your decision is what takes precedence.\nI&#39;m looking forward to seeing what kind of person you choose, “Producer”.\n\nOpera Chapter 4\n\n    Location: Practice Room\n\n\nWahahahahaha, wahahahahaha, wahahahaha…☆\nOoh, you must be surprised ‘cause I suddenly barged in! I love you, I love you even more! ☆\nWell, I overheard something interesting. You&#39;re gonna do an Opera S2, right?\nWho are the characters? Demons? Fairies? Or maybe heroes?\nOK, Tsujigiri, houseboy, and night watchmen. The setting is the latter half of the Meiji era...AaaaAH!\nIt’s expanding, a wild fantasy’s enveloping the universe... ☆ It&#39;s descending, it&#39;s descending, inspiration is coming! ☆\n♪～♪～\nHey, don&#39;t talk to me! I&#39;m playing an opera right now, grrrrrrrr!\nJapanese opera is a performing art consisting of theater and music, just like “Opera”, y’know?\nSo there’s no way I’d be the only one casted out!! After all, I&#39;m Tsuki… Tsuki...?\nCrap—?! Was I so obsessed with writing my masterpiece that I lost even my sense of self?\nWhere are we!? Who am I? AaaaAAAH!! I can&#39;t remember anything...!!\n… Tsukinaga Leo? That&#39;s right, that&#39;s the name! That was close, I almost lost my identity there...☆\nThank you, Anzu. I knew it&#39;d be right to ask you!!\nI guess I was right when I said, “If you have any trouble, ask Anzu“...☆\nAh, yeah, this is my notebook. Look, it says here, “If you have any trouble, ask Anzu”.\nBefore this, I wrote it like, “Because she’s everywhere”, but even when I called or yelled your name, you wouldn’t show up~?\nYou’re such a liar, Anzu! If I&#39;m ever kidnapped and reengineered by aliens, I&#39;ll brainwash you first!\nAnd then I’ll make it so you can only say “Ucchu~” and suffer, wahahahahaha...☆\nOh wait no, nonono!\nYou&#39;re a producer, right? What&#39;s more, you’re a talented producer that everyone relies on...☆\nSo if Anzu can only say “Ucchu~”, then no one would be able to communicate with her...!!\nNo, to be precise, it’d have probably been “Daiuchuu~☆”12, not “Ucchu~”, but…\n\nThe point is, it’d be trouble if you started talking in a voice so peculiar!\nThat would be the same universal loss as the disappearance of the infinitely-expanding seedling that is music...!\nOkay, I&#39;ve decided! Even if I am reengineered, I won’t brainwash you! So, please stay as you are...☆\n~……♪\nIt’s done, it’s done, a world-class masterpiece…! Dance and sing by my hand, and enjoy yourself~ Wahahahaha!\nSo that’s how I’ve thought up this masterpiece, but could you give me your thoughts on it?\nThere’s more acting than singing in it? Your intuition’s so good. I love you☆\nThe historical background and content are very AKATSUKI-esque, but don’t you think that’s boring?\nAlso, since it’s not just the members of AKATSUKI who’re participating, I think it’d be more fun to make it an action drama.\nMhm, mhm, I really am a genius...☆\nEh? How did I know?\nThere are countless operas hidden in the academy...! By pick them up, connecting them, and then tying them all together, the answer will come out!\nYou want me to tell you the truth? Don&#39;t talk about boring reality! Let me fantasize!\nBut I don&#39;t really mean to bother you, so I&#39;ll make an exception and tell you...☆\nLet me see… When I was passing by the garden space, I saw you and the Emperor talking.\nI listened carefully to see what it was you were talking about, and it turned out to be… an opera? “What? That seems interesting” ...☆\nThat&#39;s why I wanted to participate, too, so I made a lot of plans. So far, this is the first one!\nThe second one? You&#39;re looking for someone to play the role of Tsujigiri, right?\nHere's the second candidate for the role~☆ I'm not good at singing, but I am good at leaping and jumping~\n\nI dunno everyone in AKATSUKI, so I&#39;m the right person for the job, right?\nOhhh, she’s pondering, she’s pondering! The pose of a person thinking with her hand on her chin? You&#39;re so easy to figure out; I really do love you~☆\nHmhmhmm~♪\nNow we have all the characters! The opera, the action drama begins...☆ I can&#39;t stop, because my imagination is the whole universe!\nThere&#39;s a saying, right? Being in the right place at the right time? Leave the script to me and concentrate on making the costumes!\nNow, what kinda story should we weave? I&#39;m looking forward to it, wahahahaha...☆\n\nI thought it was noisy. It’s you, huh, Tsukinaga?\n\nAh, it&#39;s Kuro, it&#39;s been a while!\n\nIt&#39;s not like it&#39;s been that long. We&#39;re in the same class, and we had class together today, too.\n\nHuh? Is that so? Hnn? Nmmmm…?\nI remembered! Come to think of it, it&#39;s been quite a while since I was readmitted to the school. Mnn, why did I come back? Uuu, I can&#39;t remember!\n\nThis is too early of an age to be so senile. Also, don&#39;t pound your hands on someone&#39;s body.\n\nAh— sorry! Kuro’s so big that it makes me wanna bash on him~♪\n\nWhat kinda logic is that? Seriously, you’re hyper whether it&#39;s morning or the end of the day.\n\n\nIt’s ‘cause I&#39;m always communicating with the universe! C’mon Kuro, do the greeting too! Ucchu~!\n\nThe industry standard is “Good morning”. The hell’s “Ucchu~”? Are you an alien?\n\nI&#39;ve met them before, but I&#39;m not an alien!\n\nWell then, “Ucchu~” is wrong. You’ll get in all sorts of trouble if you can&#39;t greet someone properly.\n\nYou may look scary, Kuro, but you’re more like a mother. Should I call you Mom from now on?\nBut I don&#39;t want a mom this big! Never mind, Kuro is just Kuro after all. Here boy, Kuro~♪\n\nI&#39;m not a dog or cat, y’know.\n\nI know. Kuro is Kuro... ☆ So, why’re you here? Did you receive radio waves or something?\n\nDon’t mix me up with you. You should have a guess given I’m wearin’ my practice clothes, but…\nThere’s not much time left until the S2.\nI gotta give out a performance that makes lil’ Miss glad she produced us…♪\n\nOpera Chapter 5\n\n    Location: Practice Room\n\n\nSo admirable, Kuro. I&#39;ll praise you~ There, there~♪\n\nYou don&#39;t need to tip-toe and stretch just to pat me. More importantly, why’re you here, Tsukinaga? Did you have business with Anzu?\n\nWell, when I heard that Anzu was going to do an opera, I thought it was interesting, so I decided to take part too...☆\n\nSo, does that mean you’ll play the role of Tsujigiri...? Compared to Hibiki, you pack a little less of a punch.\nThen again, you have crazy good physical ability, so I&#39;m sure you’ll be just as good on stage as him...♪\nNow all we have to do is create the script and costumes... huh? Tsukinaga’s thinking up the script?\nHe forced himself into your plans? Lil’ Miss also met with disaster, huh? That’s just how Tsukinaga is; a wild guy, don’tcha think?\nThe fact that he doesn&#39;t listen to what others hafta say hasn&#39;t changed from the beginning. I can&#39;t help but wonder why Tsukinaga wasn&#39;t counted as one of the “Five Eccentrics”.\nBut... Tsukinaga? If Hasumi finds out about this, he&#39;ll probably pass out...?\n\nWho’s Hasumi? Is he an alien!?\n\nStop trying to connect everything to space. And you gotta stop forgetting everything, man.\n\nI&#39;ve been busy since the end of the year, and then there was also winter break…?\nWhen you keep staying at home and then going out over and over, you&#39;ll forget a lot of things~♪\nHasumi...Hasumi...Hasumin... I got it now, he’s a friend of fairies~☆13\nSo does this mean that Kuro is a resident of fairy-tale, and you’re even friends with fairies? Wow, you’re part of a fairy-tale even though you’re so humongous!\n\n… You seriously don&#39;t remember? Or have you finally gone crazy?\nHasumi is in the same archery club as you, and he&#39;s the head of it, too.\n\nAhhh nooo, don&#39;t give me a simple answer like that! You’re just like Keito, so boring with conversations!\n\nThe hell, you do remember him, then. If you&#39;re this forgetful, won’t it be hard for you to remember your lines...?\n\nWhat someone should remember and what they don&#39;t care about are two different things, right? I&#39;m not such an incompetent king that I forget everything!\nWell, whatever. The point is, that&#39;s why I&#39;m participating too! Look forward to the kinda opera I’ll perform, wahahahahaha...☆\n\n\n    Location: Student Council Room\n\n\n… Phew, just one more seal on this document, and I can give it a rest.\nI thought I wouldn&#39;t make it when I had to work on such short notice, but finishing this up will allow me to participate in practice without any problems.\nMm? Kanzaki, is that you? I don’t have any particular task for you today–\n\nJust here t’visit.\n\nAnzu and Kiryu…? You&#39;re wearing your practice clothes, wh-... Ah, you came to get me because I hadn&#39;t shown up?\nSorry to keep you waiting. But this is good timing, as I&#39;ve just finished my work. I&#39;ve already gotten changed, so that won&#39;t take up any time.\n\nSorry to interrupt your enthusiasm, but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re here to talk about.\nYou also asked lil&#39; miss to find another Tsujigiri for you, right?\n\nSo, you did?\n\nHe was found alright. Or more like, it was forced entry....... Hasumi, don&#39;t freak out, just listen to me.\nThe Tsujigiri role’s gonna be filled in by Tsukinaga.\n\n\n…………\n\nOi, Hasumi-no-danna~?14 Pull it together. I know it&#39;s jarrin&#39;, but it&#39;s forreal.\nShould I say it a bunch’a times &#39;til you can face the reality of it?\n\nN-... No, it’s… fine… I was just a little dizzy from all the different ... colorful personalities. Hibiki and Tsukinaga...\nI won’t lecture this matter to Anzu, too much. He’s the personification of a whirlwind. Our common sense won&#39;t apply at all to him.\nTsukinaga probably pushed her into it. If anything, I sympathize with her.\n\nSo you don&#39;t have a problem with Tsukinaga participatin&#39;?\n\nThere are plenty of problems, but I guess it can&#39;t be helped. There’s not many people out there that can keep up with Hibiki of the &quot;Three Eccentrics&quot;.\nAnyway, I&#39;ll keep an eye on it to make sure nothing goes awry. ...... Maybe I should ask Isara to order some extra stomach medicine for me.\n\n\n    Location: Opera Stage\n\n\n(U, Uuu~ It’s finally the day of Opera!)\n(I’m happy to be on the same stage as Taishou again, but my legs won’t stop wobbling from the nerves…~)\n(Whenever I’m with everyone in RYUSEITAI, my mind feels pretty focused, but right now it’s totally blank. I can barely think, like I’ve been thrown on stage completely naked.)\n(Maybe I’m just terrified after hearin’ about the other members of [Opera] from Anzu-anego......)\n(I’m the only first-year, and the rest are second-years and third-years. And what’s more, there’s two of Yumenosaki’s strongest units’ leaders here. Ah– and if you count Taichou, that’s three.)\n(Ugh! I’m clearly the only one who sticks out here! If I screw it up, it’ll be completely obvious!?)\n\n…… Kiryu doesn’t seem to be concerned, and you’ve had plenty of practice, haven’t you?\n\nO-Ossu! I practiced a lot until Taishou said it looked good, so I’ll be fine I think! I look forward to working with you today!!\n\nAh, I’ll leave it to you, then.\n\n(Uwaaa, I’m so nervous that I can barely think of any topics to talk about~! The silence is painful!)\n(I practiced tons with Taishou and Taichou, but I didn’t practice enough with Hasumi-senpai. Honestly, I’m worried if I’ll be able to do well…)\n(Plus, I was too distracted by the other seniors at the joint rehearsal ’cause they were so lively. And I&#39;m extra worried about the &quot;Opera,&quot; since it isn&#39;t the typical song-and-dance performance!)\n(No—! Don’t get scared! Men need to have guts! Ossu, Nagumo Tetora. Let&#39;s do this~!!)\nH-Hashumi-shenpai!\n(UaaaAAAA! I fumbled it, completely, magnificently fumbled it! Hasumi-senpai’s lookin’ at me like, “What the hell is with this guy?” I can’t handle bein’ here any longer~!)\n\nDon’t look so anxious, the real show is about to begin. You were chosen as a member of “Opera”, so make sure to be dignified.\n\nY… You’re not angry?\n\nThere&#39;s no reason to be angry. I had a hard time during my first year too. I can understand your nervousness.\nYou&#39;re still a first-year. There’s no one in this world who’s perfect from the beginning. The real deal is those who work hard to get what they want.\n“Opera” will be a good experience for you. Don&#39;t be afraid of “What if I fail, though…”\nFailure is also a valuable experience. Although of course, it&#39;s better not to fail.\n\n… Hasumi-senpai.\n\nI think we’ve talked a little too much. The curtains are about to rise. Get ready too.\n\n\n(Ever since I failed the AKATSUKI exam, It felt kinda like a struggle to be around Hasumi-senpai.)\n(But I feel like I understand why Taishou wanted to follow Hasumi-senpai just a lil’ bit more, now...♪)\n\nOpera Chapter 6\n\n    Location: Opera Stage\n\n\n&quot;Come, come, observe! An incredibly hilarious, ridiculous tragicomedy is starting～♪”\n“The script? Written by me~ I&#39;m an amazing genius loved by God, so a screenplay is child’s play~☆”\n&quot;Now then! The curtain’s about to rise~ so take your seats and welcome us with thunderous applause! Wahahahahaha......☆&quot;\n\nOi, Tsukinaga. Y’know I’m about to catch you and throw you in jail soon, right? So why’re you acting so weirdly giddy?\n\nOoh, Kuro. Your eyes are so serious! You could kill a man with that gaze……☆\nBut sorry! I’m not that easy to catch…! Where’s the fun in that~?\nYou also know I won’t make it easy for you, don’t you?\nI’ll fight with all my might, so you should come at me good, Kuro~\nI may have taken a lot of time off idol work, but I figured now would be good to fight on the frontlines from here on.\nLet’s show our gallant figures to the rookies. Let’s make ‘em think, “being an idol really is fun”.\nIf we can make ‘em wanna take after us, wouldn’t that be the most fun ever?\n\n…… You’re right. It’s just as you say.\nI’ve got a cute junior performing in Opera, too. I can’t show him anything uncool, huh?\n\n\nGood, good, that bloodlust! Wouldn’t you be more suited for a Tsujigiri than a watchman~?\nWell then, I’ll have to get serious, too. I can’t take the Emperor’s head until I defeat Kuro.……☆\n\nFufu, how dreadful. I’m just a houseboy right now. If a Tsujigiri came for my life, I wouldn’t stand a chance.\n\nYou say that, but aren’t you a little too calm and composed about it?\nIf you don’t give us more of a sense of urgency that you’re gettin’ snatched by Tsukinaga, the audience isn’t gonna feel it either.\n\nBut I certainly meant to act in accordance with Tsukinaga-kun&#39;s script.\n\nAh, gotcha, gotcha. In other words, you may be dressed up like some modest houseboy, but you’re still undeniably the Emperor.\n\n\nWhoops. If I keep saying things that aren’t in the script, the audience’ll get confused. Let’s just talk swords from here on out……♪\n“Prepare yourself, Tsujigiri.”\n\n(Ohh… Taishou, you’re so powerful! If I was a Tsujigiri, I’d give up before the fight even started!)\n(It’s amazing the other guy doesn’t even balk when he sees bloodlust like that.)\n(As expected of the powerhouse unit… the leader of Knights!)\n\nNagumo, don’t lose focus. Who’s our enemy? It’s Hibiki, not Tsukinaga, right?\n\nO-Ossu! Sorry!! I’ll reflect on this!!\n\nIf you have the time to reflect, you have the time to act… Kh…!\n\nHasumi-senpai!?\n\n“... Nagumo, concentrate. Right now, I’m the Taichou.”\n\n“Oh? What’s wrong, my archnemesis? Aren’t you my fated rival? If that’s true, then you should be able to evade my blade…!!”\n“You shouldn’t be babysitting while you try to fight me; I’m not that easy of an enemy to defeat, you know?”\n\n“Hmph, that was just a tryout.”\n\n“Fufufu, you’re bad at lying, aren’t you? Well, it’s fine. If that was just a tryout, then come at me with your full strength, please.”\n“Or else, I’ll go for snapping your knees, do you understand…?”\n\n(Incorrigible, Anzu let this horrific guy participate, too. That clown has only been ad-libbing, it’s entirely different from what we practiced…)\n(No, I’ll stop complaining. I’m the leader of AKATSUKI. I won’t let the likes of Hibiki get away with this.)\n\n“～……♪”\n\n(But… It’ll be bad if this keeps going. Having to act while singing is different from a typical performance. It’s difficult moving from one place to another.)\n(Not to mention, Nagumo seems to be the kind of person who acts on instinct, so he keeps moving without thinking.)\n(While Hibiki is the type of person who’d toy with his opponent. Nagumo isn’t compatible with someone like him.)\n(In that case, what about Kanzaki? … He and Nagumo both have that straightforward side to them. They’re trying to catch him off guard for an attack, but he’s parrying successfully.)\n(Morisawa also has capabilities, but his hands seem to be full backing up Nagumo and Kanzaki.)\n(As for Kiryu, he’s facing off against Tsukinaga on his own, so this is a four-man operation all to pin down Hibiki on his own…)\n\n\n(Just as I thought, I’ve got no choice but to rework my strategy.)\nNagumo, on my sign, flank Hibiki from behind. Kanzaki, you too. Join Nagumo.\nMorisawa, watch the scene, play it by ear, and move in when the time’s right.\n(Up until now, we’ve been scattered in trying to take on Hibiki, so we managed to make an opening.)\n(If it were just some random person, I’d have been able to defeat him just like that, but it’s Hibiki Wataru of the Three Eccentrics.)\n(Given the circumstances, even with Morisawa, we can’t defeat Hibiki.)\n\n&quot;You look like you&#39;re planning something! Splendid! Just what I’d expect from my lifetime rival......☆”\n\n&quot;I feel like I’ve said this many times before, but I don’t remember ever becoming your rival.”\n\n&quot;Fufufu, so humble! If you would, please don’t fail my expectations. Night watchmen......☆&quot;\n\n(He really prattles on a lot. Nevertheless, I’ll make sure he regrets that behavior backfiring on him.)\n(Nagumo, now…!)\n\n“Nagumo Tetora, on the move! UUOOOOHHH…!!”\n\n“Divine punishment…!”\n\n“Oops, a surprise attack from behind is very clever. But—”\n\n“HA-HA-HA, I’ve blocked your way out! Prepare yourself for the confines of justice……☆”\n\n“You heard him. I won’t let you get away, Hibiki.”\n\n“Well, it’s four against one. If you coordinate like that, there’s nothing I can do to escape.”\n“Very well then. I’ll come quietly…♪”\n\nLooks like it&#39;s all settled over there.\nAs long as those guys join forces, even someone like you won’t be able to handle it.\nWe’re wrapping up the swordplay. After the break, the main event is the live performance. Let&#39;s hurry up and get ready.\n\nI see, I see. That’s too bad, I wanted to play a little longer~\n\nI feel the same as Tsukinaga-kun. It’s so much fun that I can’t help but laugh.\n(Cough, cough)\n\nThat&#39;s not laughter, that&#39;s a cough. Maybe your health got worse after Tsukinaga swung you around so much?\n\nThat might be it, huh? It was fun, like a roller coaster, but I think I reached my physical limit first.\nThanks for entertaining me, Tsukinaga-kun......♪\n\nI didn&#39;t mean to entertain the Emperor, though. Oh well, it’s fine.\nI had fun, too! The audience and Anzu were all happy! I could write a masterpiece based on that fact alone!\nThis is what makes life so interesting~☆ Even when the curtain falls, I’ll keep singing and dancing, because I’m the Naked King, wahahahaha~☆15\nEpilogue\n\n    Location: Opera Stage\n\n\nKuro, Keito, Anzu, thanks for your hard work~☆\n\nJust what are you thanking us for? Even though the curtain went down, you made such a clamor that we had to take the stage for an encore.\nAnd at the end of it, you invited Anzu to come and stand on stage too. It was unprecedented!\n\n‘Cause Anzu’s one of us. It&#39;s not good to be left out, right~?\n\n… You’re hopeless. You’re the same now as you were in the past.\nOh, yeah. I remember what I was going to tell you ...... Hey, why are you shrinking back?\n\nIt’s ‘cuz Keito’s sermons are long. And even Anzu looks traumatized from a lecture you gave her, yeah?\n\nM-Mm. Is this about… Quarrel Festival?\nBut that initial proposal was really awful. It was so terrible it made me dizzy.\n\nHasumi, leave it at that. Lil Miss’s so shocked that she&#39;s dissociating.\n\nS-Sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to harp on about something that’s done and gone.\nAt any rate, it&#39;s true that that one incident gave me an appreciation for Anzu. There are only a few people who can get back on their feet from one of my lectures.\nI was nervous about what would happen with Tsukinaga participating in the opera, but the audience was very receptive to it.\nI look forward to working with you from now on as well, &quot;Producer&quot;.\n\nOh, even Keito can make a gentle face, a new discovery. ......☆\nWhile I was away, the &quot;Emperor&quot; was defeated, and a revolution happened. Yumenosaki Academy is too interesting...☆.\nAaaaaah, I think I can write a magnificent song now! I have to write down my inspiration before I forget!\n\nDon&#39;t scribble magic pen on the floor and walls. You tried to doodle on the floors of the archery grounds before—\n…………\n\nHmmm, is something on my face? Did I accidentally get magic marker on it?\n\nOhh, I remember, I remember very clearly. That damned memory…\n\nThat was a complete about-face from gentle to demonic!?16 You&#39;re so interesting, I love you ☆\n\nI hate you.\nHeh… Heheh, heheh… Thanks to all your scribbling on the floor and walls of the archery hall, I spent the whole night trying to erase it.\nI was going to tell you to turn up to club activities, but I take it back. Tsukinaga Leo, you are to never step over the threshold of the archery hall again.\n\nOK, got it~♪\n\nWh–...... you agreed just like that? Shouldn’t you be more worried or regretful or something!?\n\nMm~ Well, I&#39;m a ghost member17. I&#39;d rather teach Anzu how to write songs, anyways.\nIt won&#39;t be long before I graduate, so I have to get Anzu to full operation by then, yeah~?\nWouldn’t it be sad to see all that effort I put into teaching her go to waste?\nI mean, it&#39;s a world-wide loss to have my valuable spare time squandered on something that&#39;s pointless!\nThat&#39;s why I don&#39;t have time to show up for club activities. Sorry, Keito.\n\nHmph. I&#39;m the one who kicked you out, so it’s not like you have to apologize.\n\nKeito’s such a tsundere!\nAhh, I just casually used slang~!? So stupid of me! I’m a genius but an idiot, too!!\nWell, it’s fine. That’s what I plan to do, so you&#39;d better work harder with what little time we have left, okay~?\nKnights are invincible with the weapons I provide, but you should at least be able to offer a piece of advice to the others when they’re in a tight spot.\nDon&#39;t forget that the line and staff are a key balance in war.\nNow I know that they took great care of the Knights while I was gone.\n\nLil Miss’s a hardworking girl, y’know.\nThere’s no complaints to make about her costume-making skills, and I can&#39;t wait to see how good of a tailor she’ll be by the time I graduate.\nWhoa, don&#39;t look so sad. I’m bad with gloomy moods…\nWell, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re graduating anytime soon. There are still a lotta things I wanna teach Tetsu, anyway.\n\nThere’s a reason Kiryu praises him; Nagumo has a lot of room for growth. His impulsiveness is a weak point, but I think he’s a good and honest junior.\n\nYeah. He’s a junior that’s way too good for me...♪\nBut it’s only at times like these that Tetsu&#39;s not around, huh... If Tetsu heard that line, I think he’d have cried with joy.\n‘Cause he looked real depressed when he failed Hasumi’s exam.\n\nBut as a result of that, Nagumo is where he is today. His place of belonging wasn’t with AKATSUKI, but with RYUSEITAI. That&#39;s how it is, isn&#39;t it?\n\nHow hopeless, Hasumi-no-danna really just isn&#39;t an honest guy, huh. “Tsundere”, was it? Maybe that’s not so wrong after all…♪\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ From the story Quarrel Festival. This will come up a lot.↑ The Meiji Era (明治時代) (1868-1912) is the backdrop for Opera, marked by major political, economic and social change, rapid modernization, industrialization and Westernization in Japan.↑ During the Meiji Era, houseboys were aspiring-students who lived in hosts' homes as they traveled to cities to study.↑ Tsujigiri (辻斬り or 辻斬, lit. &quot;crossroads killing&quot;) was a samurai-practice where samurai test a new sword's effectiveness by attacking (usually defenseless) passersby. In this story, they use Tsujigiri as a noun.↑ Among other things, an affirmative and greeting Tetora uses↑ Tetora refers to Kuro as 大将 (taishou, lit. high-ranking general ), or boss. Not to be confused with Chiaki's 隊長 (taichou).↑ There's a similar line in Tough Guy about Kuro's forgetfulness. Cute!↑ 道場破り (dojoyaburi, lit. dojo storming ). In martial arts, this is when someone visits rival martial arts schools and challenges its members to assert dominance over whose technique is better. If the dojo lost, its apprentices would abandon it for the winner's school. Read more here.↑ We tried our best. He used 人徳 (lit. natural virtue) here. He's trying to get at the fact there's something fundamentally different about him and Kuro that's ultimately out of his control.↑ Souma says the same thing in Scroll of the Elements. We love callbacks!↑ Souma's running gag is regularly resorting to performing seppuku to make up for trouble. 切腹 (seppuku or harakiri, lit. belly-cutting ) was a form of ritualistic suicide samurai used for a variety of reasons. For Souma, that tends to be shame.↑ This is actually an Ensemble Girls reference.↑ &quot;Hasumin fairies&quot; on Google found this manga about a boy named Ian Hasumi who can see fairies. Do with that as you will.↑ Kuro often refers to Keito as 旦那 (danna, lit. master), or &quot;boss&quot;. Hasumi-no-danna is a variation of this.↑ A reference to the Emperor's New Clothes.↑ He references a Hannya (般若) mask, specifically. It's from Noh theatre.↑ 幽霊部員 (yuurei buin, lit. ghost members). It's someone who's a member of a club on paper, but otherwise just doesn't show up or participate in club activities."},{"title":"9th Anniversary Log-In | Keito and Kanata","url":"/translation//9th_anniversary_dialogue/","content":"\n .translationsquare video {\n  /* Make video to at least 100% wide and tall */\n  max-width: 100%; \n  max-height: 100%; \n\n  /* Setting width & height to auto prevents the browser from stretching or squishing the video */\n  width: auto;\n  height: auto;\n}\n\n\n\nLet’s give everyone here a performance they won’t forget.

I&#39;d like to show you my favorite works, but if we can&#39;t read them all in one day, we can come back another time.\n\n How about window-shoppin’? We won&#39;t run outta things to talk about when we’re lookin’ at all the different shops and goods. We can find out each other’s taste in fashion and what sorta trends are hot, too.\n\n What about a “cat ka-fay”? Cats look so adorable, just seeing them is sure to make the two of us smile...~♪\n\nI’d like to go to a theme park! ‘Cuz there’s all sortsa things we could do there together, like going on a buncha rides, pickin’ out souvenirs, and so much more~♪\n\nI think anywhere would be fun, as long as I’m with the person I love, but… For me, it’d be even more fun if we were at a place that has yuruchara.\n\nI would love an opportunity to lead the way around a ninja village! I want to show all there is to know about my favorite thing! Be it by witnessing ninjutsu together, having a first-hand experience with it, or anything else of the like~♪\n\nA date means going to the amusement park! There’s roller coasters, the ferris wheel, and most of all, hero shows! The day would pass by in a flash! ☆ ☆\n\non warm days, i would like to have fun at the [ocean]~ and in the colder seasons, we can visit the [aquarium]…♪\n What are the last texts you’ve exchanged with a unit member?\n I contacted Kiryu and Kanzaki about our work schedules, but neither of them responded. Well, that isn’t unusual, though.\n\n I wanted to hear what their plans were for our new song, so I hit ‘em up. After that, we ended up meetin&#39; up and talkin&#39; face-to-face.\n\n I hadn&#39;t realized I&#39;d sent an incomprehensible string of characters, so I contacted my seniors to apologize. Handling a &quot;sumaho&quot; is difficult…\n\n I messaged everyone to decide on when to have our next practice session together! Midori-kun’s the only one who hasn’t responded yet, so I’m just gonna go and ask him directly!\n\nMy parents gave me lots of vegetables, so I asked everyone in my unit if they’d like some before I asked anyone else. I’ll bring the vegetables over to them later.\n\nTetora-kun sent me our agenda for the practice session, so I replied to that! I’m in charge of booking us a practice room~♪\n\nI got my hands on some ninja-themed sentai merchandise, so I couldn’t help but message Sengoku about it. It made me happy to get a text praising how cool it looks! ☆\n\ni messaged chiaki that i am at the [ocean]. he gets [worried] when i do not tell him [where] i am.\n\n Why are you so cool?\n It&#39;s because of the support and encouragement around me. My friends and allies are the reason I can stand on stage and strive for greater heights.\n\n I guess it&#39;s ‘cuz AKATSUKI is where I can be with Hasumi ‘n Kanzaki. When I see those two honest guys, it’s like my spine just straightens up on its own.\n\n There&#39;s something about that comment that makes me feel bashful. However, I&#39;m pleased if my daily training has led to that kind of impression.\n\nMaybe it’s ‘cuz everyone’s always supporting me? Also, if you think my constant hard work towards my goal is somethin’ “cool”, then I’m real happy ‘bout that!\n\nI don’t really know how to answer that… But I think that it’s thanks to my parents that I was born with this face, so I’ll express my gratitude to them later…\n\nI-I’m cool? It surprises me to hear that, but I’d certainly be glad if you consider ninjas to be something cool!\n\nIt might be because I dream of becoming a hero. And not just any hero, but a “cool” one…☆\n\nit is because there are so many [cool] people around me~ so maybe i am also more likely to be seen as cool along with them…?\n What are your best subjects?\n You could say that liberal arts as a whole are my strongpoint. I believe I&#39;ve not only excelled in Japanese language and history, but also in civics.\n\n I&#39;m good at sewin’ and cookin’, so home economics is my forte. I usually suck at studying the classic way... especially math; it hurts my head.\n\n I enjoy classical literature and Japanese history. On the contrary, I am not as good at English and world history. While I improve on my current abilities, I want to overcome my weaknesses too.\n\nI’m confident with my practical classes, like P.E. and home economics~♪ I wanna get better at theory-based subjects too, but it’s pretty difficult for me…\n\nMath’s my best subject, or more like, it’s the only thing I can do…? I’m not at all good with other subjects, so I think I’m pretty compatible with it.\n\nI’ve got a bit of confidence when it comes to Japanese history! I studied a whole lot to make myself well-versed with the era of ninjas~♪ \n\nMy best subjects are the liberal arts, like Japanese literature and language! And my weakest subject is Math. I would always study until late at night before a test for that class.\n\n[history] and [biology] might be my best subjects? well, i say [biology], but i actually mean [fish]…♪\n What’s the first thing you do when you wake up nowadays?\n I try to set aside the time for meditation. Not only does it improve my ability to concentrate and relax, but it seems to have a positive effect on creativity too.\n\n A while ago, I fell asleep with the light on in my room. Guess that’s why the first thing I do when I get up is to check if they’re still on.\n\n I prepare breakfast. Now that I have a new kitchen knife, I look forward to cooking with it every day~♪\n\nI heard it’s good for your health if you drink a glass of water in the morning, so I do that. After that, I go out for my morning training routine.\n\nI play a yuruchara game on my phone. That’s the best way to spend time whenever you want to lie in bed for a little longer.\n\nI try to do exercises that help you grow taller. I hope it works out, even if I only grow a tiny bit more~\n\nI begin my day with a fresh start by doing radio exercises! I get to move every muscle in my body in an efficient manner, and it also feels really good to refresh my mind and body first thing in the morning!\n\ni have new [fishies] in my room’s [water tanks], so i [check] how they are doing when i [greet] them~♪\n SUMMER: What do you want to do at summer festivals?\n  Just hearing the festival music drifting in the air lifts my spirits. It would be nice to listen to it while refreshing myself in the cool breeze of the evening.\n\n When it comes t’festivals, I wanna chow down on some shaved ice, but… I always get a brain freeze. Is it ‘cuz I take too big’a bites out of ‘em…?\n\n I would like to eat yakisoba coated entirely with “saw-su”~♪ I’ll never forget that sensation it brought when I tasted them for the first time…! It was something I’d never felt before…!\n\nI wanna check out all sortsa festival stalls~ Like the one for scoopin’ up goldfish! I bet it’d also be fun to go against someone and see who can scoop up the most!\n\nYuruchara masks are being sold lately, so if there’s a stall selling them, I’d like to check it out. I might buy one if I find anything I like.\n\nFestivals can only mean one thing, and that’s street food! I’d like to be deliberate about what I choose to eat. I’ve been curious to know what sort of texture the tornado potatoes have~♪\n\nBefore calling it a day at the festival, how does buying sparklers sound? I’d love to talk with my friends and comrades about our time at the festival all the while. That would definitely make it the best summer ever…☆\n\ni would probably [sweat] from the humidity, so i would like to [hydrate] myself by eating [chilled pineapple]~3\n SUMMER: What are your memories of summer vacation homework?10\n Mornings at the temple start early, so I’d do my homework after morning services were done. By the time I finished it all, it’d be right in time for lunch.\n\n I&#39;m damn awful at studyin’, and my eyes just can’t stay open when I’m readin’ paragraphs ‘n stuff... So I always put it all off ‘til the last second.\n\n Because English assignments take me a considerable amount of time, I would make a schedule and face it head-on. I sought out help from my friends for the portions I didn&#39;t understand.\n\nI’m real bad at studying, so I can’t help but procrastinate on my homework… But I never do anythin’ like copying off answers from a classmate!\n\nHelping out at my family’s store makes the days go by so fast that it becomes August in no time, so… Oh, actually, I remember making a yuruchara with the cardboard boxes we had at the shop…\n\nWhy, I made my research project about ninjas, of course! My teacher praised me for it, saying it was thoroughly organized~♪\n\nI would always work on my homework a little at a time each day after my morning radio exercises. I always felt refreshed thanks to the exercise, and it helped me progress through the homework by a lot!\n\nahh, mikejima would sometimes bring over [homework], yes… i simply just watched, you know?\n AUTUMN: What would you do if you encountered a ghost?\n You might expect exorcism via use of paper slips from me, but I don’t have that ability. Well, I can chant sutras at least, though.\n\n It’d be best if we didn’t have to use our fists, but — if somethin’s about to attack, it’s up to us seniors to fight back, right?\n\n If something were to attempt to harm anyone, I’d hack them down with my sword in an instant. Whatever happens, rest assured! I will win without fail.\n\n I’ll fight back with my karate to protect everyone! Ah, but are physical attacks even effective on ghosts in the first place…?\n\nI feel like I’d panic and end up showing a really pathetic side of myself… Ahh, then again, if someone even more afraid than me was around, I think it’d actually make me feel calm instead?\n\nChoosing not to fight against an unwinnable opponent is a praiseworthy strategy of its own. I would use a smoke screen with my ninpou, so as to make an escape away from the ghost!\n\nEeeek!? Ghost!? S-S-S-Sorry. This is the one topic I can’t for the life of me talk about, so let me pass on this one, please…!\n\nlike an [umibouzu]?4 i cannot swim, so i would be in trouble if i got pulled into the [water], wouldn’t i~\n AUTUMN: What’s your favorite kind of ramen?\n If I had to choose, miso—… Ah no, I like tan tan ramen5 as well. It’s the perfect choice whenever you feel like eating something spicy.\n\n I like abura soba6, it’s somethin’ that’s nice and hearty, and it really hits the spot. Add a lil’ rice and toppings by the end of it and ya got a new flavor you can enjoy again.\n\n I have a fondness for shoyu ramen. I found a good establishment in town, so I took AKATSUKI to eat there. It suited both of their tastes as well~♪\n\nInstant noodles at night are the best! Heh, and I just recently mastered using the kettle, so I’m pretty good at makin’ cup noodles!7\n\nI guess I like ramen with lots of vegetables in it. Like cabbage, bean sprouts… It gives the ramen a lot of substance, so it keeps me full.\n\nThe abura soba I ate with Tetora-kun and Midori-kun was delicious.6 And when I was almost done, I added rice onto the bowl and ate up the whole meal!\n\nI was recently introduced to a ramen restaurant that uses seafood soup, so… I always eat at that restaurant whenever I’m in the mood for ramen!\n\ni am [not good] with hot things, so when there is [chilled chinese noodles] in the [cafeteria’s menu], i go with that~\n WINTER: What’s a TV program you’d like to appear on for New Years?\nCalligraphy has developed into its own kind of performance these days, so I think a broadcast about doing the first calligraphy of the year would be interesting.\n\nI’m interested in osechi makin’11, so I’d like to be taught how to do it on a cookin’ show. I wanna make some tasty datemaki12 for my kid sister.\n\nHow about broadcasting waterfall rituals13 for good health for the year? It would be dangerous for amateurs to attempt it, so I intend to show the audience how to do it properly. \n\nIt’s more like an event rather than a program, but… I heard that on New Year’s, there’s a dojo that does karate while standing out in the ocean!14 I’d love to take part in it!\n\nI’d rather relax on New Year’s… But I might feel motivated to appear on a program if there’ll be yuruchara on it, too…?\n\nI would like to appear on a history program! I want to know what ninjas used to do to ring in the New Year season!\n\nWould it be possible to interview long-distance relay race runners? I’d love to try and have talks with them — They juggle both training and studies at the same time!15\n\ni would love to appear on a [cooking show]. let’s make the new year’s feast with ingredients like [sea bream] and [kombu]~♪16\n\n WINTER: How far can you do an outside activity alone?\nWhenever I return home, I do sutra chants on my own now and again. Reciting sutra in the stillness of the morning makes my mind feel as though it’s being sharpened.\n\nIt felt hard to ask someone to come with, so I went on my own to watch a pro wrestling match just the other day. It was a pretty damn exciting bout, I can tell ya that.\n\nThere is a “tapioka” shop I’ve frequented regularly since I was a student17, so I stop and buy a drink from time to time. This is what they call the solo “tapioka” experience!18\n\nI’m pretty interested in tryin’ out camping on my own! I’ll have to prepare all the equipment first… Also, I wanna try my hand at making camp food, too!\n\nI stand out easily because of my height, so I’d prefer to stay away from places where there’s a lot of people. If I end up going out somewhere, at most I’d go to a yuruchara event.\n\nNinjas always conceal themselves in solitude, so I have been training myself in the park all alone. But lately, Mayoi-dono joins me in training, and that makes me happy! ♪\n\nI go watch hero shows by myself on my days off.19 But the kiddos come first, of course! So I make sure to watch from the back!\n\ngoing to the [aquarium] alone is a lovely experience of its own, you know~♪ it is soothing to take your time and look at all the [water tanks]~\n SPRING: What kind of songs do you sing at karaoke?\nI don’t go to karaoke often to begin with. I can sing a few rock songs, so there’s been times I’ve sung those before.\n\nWhen I go to karaoke with my kid sister, she picks out stuff like anime songs. They’re so catchy they get stuck in my head, so I’d say I can sing one of those now too.\n\nHmm, a place like “karaoke” is a little beyond me. I would like to try going with everyone in AKATSUKI to try it out!\n\nYou can’t do karaoke without excitin’ songs~♪ I also like having food there, so I order a buncha stuff, like french fries and pizza!\n\nI’d rather not stand out, so I leave the singing to everyone else. Ah, but when a Ryuseitai song gets chosen, I might sing my parts at least.\n\nIt’s fun to sing, of course, but if there’s ever a soft serve ice cream machine in the drink bar, I simply can’t resist the pull it has on me~♪\n\nThere’s nothing more exhilarating than singing hero songs in chronological order!20 I know every transformation pose by heart, so I strike the poses along with the video playing on the screen! ☆21\n\ni sing [songs] that i can sing along with everyone~ singing makes my [throat] dry, so i make sure i have water at the [ready].\n\n SPRING: What's the focus of today's coordinated outfit?\nI try to keep my look as simple as I can. Kiryu told me that I look like “someone’s old man on vacation,” though; was my outfit really that plain-looking…?\n\nI’m not all that familiar with fashion styles, really… I’ve got my own hand-made handkerchief, can that count as the focus?\n\nI always wear my sword, so I try to be mindful and wear clothing that does not obstruct its movement, should I need to unsheathe it in case of an emergency.\n\nI put a cap on to give it a try! As an idol, I gotta be aware of the trends and what’s in style, so I’m on a fashion trainin’ regime!\n\nI’m not really interested in fashion, so I basically just wear the same shirt and pants all the time… I don’t really get how to coordinate clothes…\n\nIt’s difficult to tell from afar, but there’s ninja embroidery on the chest. I found this attire at the souvenir section~♪\n\nWhy, the burning flame of Red, of course! …Oh, sorry, that explanation didn’t make much sense, did it? The red line on my shirt is the key point! ♪\n\ni chose [clothes] that will dry up easily even after bathing in water~ with these [clothes], i can [puka puka] anytime~♪\n\nOshi Calls\n Keito Hasumi\n\n “This is Hasumi Keito from AKATSUKI. To put it bluntly, I’m wondering if you’ll choose me as your “oshi”.”\n“Er, I’m sorry if I caught you off guard. If I hope to be chosen, I should probably talk more about my charm in my own words. Well then…”\n“As AKATSUKI’s leader, I build up experience as an idol day by day. I work hard to make sure AKATSUKI evolves until everyone knows who we are as a unit.”\n“Also…… Well, it’d be a long story if I were to go on. I’ll strive to give it my all, and let my work speak for itself. Keep your eyes on me, and see for yourself if I’m worthy of being your “oshi”.”\n\n Kuro Kiryu\n\n “Yo, I’m Kiryu Kuro. I work as part of AKATSUKI.”\n“I&#39;m not really used to sellin’ myself, but this is a great opportunity. I gotta make sure you get to know a li’l bit about me.”\n“The thing I&#39;m good at is sewin’. I make costumes for AKATSUKI, but I also stitch up outfits for other people if they request it. So, well, guess you could say I&#39;m good with my hands.”\n“I dunno if if I did a good job showin’ off my good points…… but if you choose to support me, I&#39;ll repay it in full. If it’s fine with you, come along with me.”\n\n Souma Kanzaki\n\n “Ohhh, it connected~♪ I presume that you must be the “aidoru fan”. I am Kanzaki Souma, It’s a pleasure to meet you!”\n“I am an “aidoru” who is a member of the “yunitto” AKATSUKI. As the descendant of a samurai clan, I’ve a sword on one side and a mindfulness of “tii-pii-ooh”2 on the other!”\n“...... To tell you the truth, I’m not sure I understand what being someone’s “oshi” really entails yet. However, I imagine it’s similar to a samurai’s pledge of devotion to their lord.”\n“I’ll show you that I’m a splendid “aidoru” worthy of your support. I hope that you will cheer for me….~♪”\n\n Tetora Nagumo\n\n“Ossu, I’m Nagumo Tetora! I’m in STARMAKER PRODUCTION’s Ryuseitai!”\n“My hobby is doin’ workouts like weight-training, and my specialty is cooking the manliest food over an open flame. I’m always in the thick of it, working hard and growing in order to become a man among men~♪”\n\n“No matter what hardship knocks me down, I’ll show you that I can stand right back up and overcome it all. That’s how I wanna move forward as an idol too, step by step!”\n“I’ll definitely become an idol so great, you’ll be glad that you chose me, so… I hope that you can support me…!”\n\n Midori Takamine\n\n“I’m Takamine Midori from Ryuseitai. Umm, I’m not too sure what to talk about here, but I’ll try…”\n\n“My family runs a greengrocer business, and I help them out often. Because of that, I like vegetables quite a bit… Ah, but the thing I love most is yuruchara~♪”\n\n“On the other hand, I have a lot of things I’m not a fan of… Ah, but maybe I shouldn’t mention those right now. I’m sorry, I always get negative so easily…”\n\n“I haven’t shown much appeal at all, but I’ll do as best as I can in my own way, so… If it’s alright, I’d be happy to have your support…♪”\n\n Shinobu Sengoku\n\n“I’m Sengoku Shinobu, a member of Ryuseitai! I’m a ‘ninja’, so I devote myself to training and discipline day after day.”\n\n“It’s difficult to explain in a few words why I chose to be a ninja, but… From a young age, I have always admired the ninja’s way of life, and so I aspired to become one myself~♪”\n“Ninjas may be ones who conceal themselves, but I’m not simply a ninja — I’m an idol as well! So I always put everything I have acquired in my ninja training to good use, even on stage!”\n\n“It would make me happy if you watched my acrobatic performances, and then choose me as your ‘oshi’~♪”\n\n Chiaki Morisawa\n\n“The hero of justice, Morisawa Chiaki—! Has just made his arrival! …Mhm, I got that pose down perfectly! ☆”\n\n“Alongside my comrades in Ryuseitai, I work hard in my activities every day, both as a hero and as an idol!”\n“I want to make everyone smile, and that feeling is stronger and more passionate than anyone else’s. I strive to always keep it that way. And most of all, the source of that burning passion is none other than the encouraging cheers of our fans!”\n\n“That’s why I’d like you to send me your support by calling for my name as loud as you can! I’m counting on you!”\n\n Kanata Shinkai\n\n“hello~♪ i am shinkai kanata from ryuseitai.”\n“i love the ocean, so i often take walks on the [beach] and [bathe] in [water]. i also love [fishies]~♪”\n\n“to give your life a plentiful amount of [replenishment] as well, i will deliver many [songs] to you.”\n\n“so i would love it if you would cheer for me. puka, puka…♪ (sways left and right)”\nThank You for Choosing Me Call\n Keito Hasumi\n\n I’m grateful you chose me as your “oshi”. Thank you.\nTo repay that kindness, I’ll aim for the top with more fervor than I have before. And I assure you that both I and Akatsuki will advance relentlessly. \nI’d like to become someone indispensable to you, too. From here on out as well, please lend me your support.\n\n Kuro Kiryu\n\n Outta all the idols out there, ya chose me, huh? Thanks.\nWell now, since you’ve chosen me, I guess I’m gonna have to fire myself up even more for yer sake too~♪\nI might end up lookin’ tactless, ‘n completely put ya off... but if I’m gonna do this, I’ll do it to the end, so I’ll show ya I can live up to yer expectations. Watch over me, okay?\n\n Souma Kanzaki\n\n Me, having become your “oshi”...! I feel quite proud of myself…♪\nIt is an “aidoru”’s honor to receive the support of their “fans”. This Kanzaki Souma will strive to work harder and harder.\nFrom now on for years to come, I will show you the fruits of my labor!\n\n Tetora Nagumo\n\nThank you so much for choosin’ to support me! I’m pumped to get this opportunity to receive your feelings!\n\nI’m still a novice, and a clumsy one at that, so it’s tough for me to grow all at once… But I’ll keep moving forward step by step, and get closer to my dreams and ideals, even if it’s only li’l by li’l.\nI’ll definitely show you that impressively grown version of me, you can count on that! So please keep watchin’ over me from now on, too…!\n\n Midori Takamine\n\nThere’s so many idols around here, but you still chose me… Thank you so much…♪\nIf someone told me to choose a single favorite yuruchara, I think I would’ve struggled a lot, so… Now that you’ve chosen me, I want to make sure I answer those feelings of yours.\n\nI don’t know how much I can actually accomplish, but… I’ll try to do as much as I’m able to. So please support me…♪\n\n Shinobu Sengoku\n\nThank you for choosing me! Nihihi, it makes me blush a little~\n\nI mostly talked about ninjas, so I am curious as to which you actually grew interested in: me, or ninjas…\nBut this simply means I must work harder and harder to ensure that you love both! I will continue to convey all those charms, so please do watch me from here on out, as well…♪\n\n Chiaki Morisawa\n\nThank you for choosing me as your “oshi”! I can say with certainty that I received your passionate feelings…☆\n\nI want to work even harder as both a hero and an idol, and be someone who can cheer anyone up. Being chosen as your “oshi” reaffirmed that resolve of mine.\n\nI’ll keep my heart burning and continue moving forward towards the future! Keep watching over my efforts from now on, too…☆\n\n Kanata Shinkai\n\nyou chose me as your [oshi]? ufufu, that makes me very happy~♪\n\ni hope to not only make you [smile], but to even [replenish] every day of your life through [song] and [dance] too—\nthose are my feelings, and so… let’s continue to spend a wonderful time together from here on out, too — you and me…♪\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \nTranslation Notes\n↑ Radio calisthenics (ラジオ体操 lit., &quot;radio exercises&quot;) are warm-up exercises performed to music and guidance from radio broadcasts.↑ This is TPO (time, place, and occasion): there is a time and place for everything.

I woulda liked to keep going for a whole five hours more~! Hey? Don't you feel that way too, Hasumi-san?\n\n… Hm? I feel like I’ve said something just like that before~\n\nThe exact same thing back during 4piece.\n\nAhh, is that right? It was pretty fun back then too, huh~?\nI’d known AKATSUKI’s songs since when I was in America, and I was interested in them, but...\nIf I hadn’t gotten to have a jam sesh with you on that stage, Hasumi-san, I don’t think I woulda wanted to stand on the same stage with AKATSUKI as much~\n\nI feel the same way.\n\n\n…\nI’m glad I got to do a live with AKATSUKI~ It was nice that being with AKATSUKI felt really cozy~ Just like Jii-chan’s house.\nIf you ever feel like getting together again, let’s do it~ Mata ya~sai 1\n\nHold it, Taki. Aren’t you looking for &quot;true Japanese-style”?\nWith that, is this one live really enough for you?\n\n? Whaddya mean by that?\n\nIf you want to find &quot;true Japanese-style”, is it not here in AKATSUKI that is the closest place you’ll find it?\n\nEh? Errr…?\n\nWell, look. Danna and Kanzaki are both dancin’ around the subject, but… what we mean to ask is— why dontcha join AKATSUKI and become our comrade?\n\n…\nBut I’ve caused tons of trouble for AKATSUKI~\nAs a kid, I have all the freedom in the world, but even a kid like me knows how to be polite, too. I can’t cause trouble for AKATSUKI anymore~\n\nSays the person who cut it close getting to the exam on time.\n\nNyahaha. Well, that was just because I didn’t know the etiquette of the mainland, though~?\n\n\nTaki. You’ve been saying you’ve “caused us trouble” for a while now, but I don’t think you’ve caused us any trouble in the first place.\nAKATSUKI is bound by a bond stronger than blood. That&#39;s because we’re comrades who have swept through countless battlefields and hardships together.\nWe watch our backs, and sometimes we can watch each other’s backs— the backs of our comrades. No one’s troubled by that.\nI didn&#39;t call out to you because I pitied your lot in life.\nI will evolve AKATSUKI with the times and take it into the next era - In order to make AKATSUKI into a &quot;tradition&quot;2, I saw you as a comrade who would fight with us on the battlefield.\n\n...\n\nSo. You’ve got yer own dream, and to make that dream come true, this unit AKATSUKI is tailor-made for it, right?\n\nI want you to lend me your strength. That’s what the deal is. So, I’ll say it once again.\n… — Taki. Won’t you join AKATSUKI?\n\n…\nHasumi-san, I wanna join AKATSUKI— No, please lemme join…!\n\nThat would be great. I look forward to working with you.3\n\nNyahaha. Thanks for having me. Talk about a load of deja vu, huh~?\n\n\n    A few days after the live. RhythLin Agency Lounge\n\n\n… Got a snide email from agency higher ups.\n… H~mm.\nWell, whatever. I’ll let it slide. If I take it seriously, I’ll just lose in the end.\nThese documents are for The Legend of KAGETSU, so they’ve already finished being processed. These ones still need to be dealt with, but... I can&#39;t do anything if I don’t have the other required documents.\nWell, the debut live is still a little bit away, so it’s not really an issue.\nSo, all that’s left is the paperwork needed for when Taki joins AKATSUKI?\n\n\n… ♪\n\nWhoa!? Sakuma, speak up when you enter. Stealing glances at people’s business is rude.\n\nSadly, I missed the window to speak up.\nYou’ve completely changed, Hasumi-kun. You went from all of that anxiety the past few weeks to working with such vigor.\nHmhm… A registration sheet for a new member…?\nOh? Will Taki-kun be joining AKATSUKI, then?\n\nYes. It’ll be announced at the next live.\n\nIs everything alright, with the opposition from the agency? I doubt it’s all smiles up there, adding a new member.\n\nGoing forward, there might be some interference here and there, but this time, I’ve made up my mind. No matter who objects to it, I’ll trust my instincts.\n\nI&#39;m rooting for you, Hasumi-kun. Overhauling everything for the sake of reexamining the foundation... I’d say that kind of pluck is very fine indeed.\nSo then, how about it? Does it look like things are going to go all according to plan for Hasumi-kun and changing for the better?\n\nIt’s not just about the change itself. We’ll show that we can change together. That’s the kind of resolve I’m talking about.\n\nHm, I see. “If you want to go faster, take it solo. If you want to go farther, go together,” right?\n\nI won’t let AKATSUKI die. With this growth and development, I’ll take it into the next era.\nBecause AKATSUKI is the legend I began, and I am the main character of that story.\n\nKu-ku-ku…♪ You took far too many detours to finally manage to get to that resolve, Hasumi-kun.\n\nHmph. Being surrounded by people with innate talent, you end up like this whether you want to or not. Because effort alone just isn’t enough.\n\nEpilogue 2\n\n    Several days later. The venue for the debut live of Shinsei AKATSUKI.4\n\n\n…\n\n? Taki, what’s got you so silent? You’re unusually tense?\n\nLook, look~! I’m wearing the AKATSUKI uniform right now~!?\nWhat are you, a kid wearin’ a hakama for the first time at Shichi-Go-San5? I mean, you had it on durin’ the costume fittin’, right?\n\nYou don’t get it, Kiryu-san~ Having the stage right in front of you while wearing the uniform gets higher points for me, y’know~\n\nWhat’s this about points? Well, if you’re that happy with it, makin’ this one feels real worth it.\nThat said, the live’s soon, but you’re not nervous? This is the first time you’re takin’ the stage as AKATSUKI, yet…?\n\nI’m not nervous or anything, y’know~ If anything, I’m so excited I can’t calm down— like I wanna start running around right now! Can I?\n\nObviously, the answer is no. We’ll be starting soon.\n\nTaki. While I can understand your glee, don’t get too overenthusiastic.\nFrom this moment on, you are a member of AKATSUKI. You need to keep in mind that you are carrying its name at all times, and maintain discipline and decorum.\n\n\nThat just reminded me of something. Kanzaki was unusually overenthusiastic the first time he put on his AKATSUKI uniform, wasn’t he?\n\nYeah. Now that ya mention it, he was like that too. He got so worked up backstage, he suddenly started doin’ practice-swings with his sword to calm down. Hasumi and I had to stop him.\n\n… Hasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono. I’d like for you to spare me any more of that.\n\nNyahaha. So there was a time when Kanzaki-san was like that too, huh~ I get it~ He was just like me~\n\nHey…! Don’t lump us together…!\n\n… Hm? It’s about time, huh?\nTaki, you’ll start by jumping out onto the stage and running around as you please, just like you did during 4piece.\n\nIs doing that kinda thing okay~? Don’t tell me to take responsibility after, ‘kay~? Give me your word, ‘kay~?\n\nIt’s scary, so let’s make a contract. I can’t feel safe if a promise isn’t put down in writing, y’know~\n\nDon’t worry. I’m not going to say that. The first move of a live show is essential. Fire up the stage in one go, like tossing kindling onto a fire pit.\n\nLives are like festivals, after all. The more you fire everyone up, the better it gets ♪\n\nJust attract the attention of the audience. If you fumble a little or get too reckless, we will cover for you on all of it.\n\nHmnm. If you all say so… Please leave it to me~ Going on a rampage is what I’m the absolute best at~\nIf anything, it’s you guys who’ll have to keep up with me? Are you gonna be okay?\n\nWho do you think you&#39;re talking to? I couldn’t ask for anything more.\nLet&#39;s go show the audience the newly reborn AKATSUKI. Let&#39;s show them an overwhelmingly Japanese-style performance.\n\n\n(Yeah, that’s right. Hasumi-san.)\n(I was putting on a brave front for Kiryu-san, but the truth is, I’m a little scared~)\n(I want to be in AKATSUKI of my own will. The more I learn about AKATSUKI, the more I like it.)\n(But just because people love AKATSUKI doesn’t mean they’ll come to love me. If that’s the case, that makes me a hindrance~)\n(I don’t really want to be rejected anymore. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been excluded from all kinds of circles~)\n(But I also take a lot of pride in the fact AKATSUKI is cherished that much~ It says “The unit I adore is the absolute strongest”~)\n(That’s why I’ll cling to it like my life depends on it. I haven’t done anything yet, so it can’t be helped I haven’t been recognized~)\n(So I’ll do whatever I can. To earn that proper recognition.)\n(If I do that, someday, it’ll be proper—)\n\nTaki, did you hear me? What’s with the blank look?\n\nNah. I heard you fine~ I’m alright~ Leave it to me, kay~?\n\nI see. Well then, let’s go!\n\n\n“Come, now! I’m the descendent of an oni that silences even crying children— Taki Ibuki!”\n“Behold the newly reborn AKATSUKI that I’ve joined!!”\n♪~♪~♪\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Uchinaaguchi for &quot;See you later&quot;.

You reacted to it instantly so it all ended up working out, Kanzaki-san~? As expected of you~♪\nThat’s exactly what I’m…!\n\n… Now, settle down. Taki. Take care not to make any strange moves during the show. I’ll be watching you.\n\nHaha. Well, it’s good to have a little bit of freedom too, though. The most important thing to do is keep from gettin’ lost in the atmosphere of the show.\n\nRight.

The MC portion was hilarious, you say?2 How incorrigible…\n… Well, as long as you had fun, I’ll consider it a good thing. Until next time.\n\nThank you for today. Heheh, I imagine AKATSUKI’s live must have been a sight to behold.\nIt’s precisely because of your support that I could stand on this stage. Look after me from here on out.\n\nOh! Your support was real noticeable, y’know~ That makes me real happy!\nCan I give you a kiss~\n— Nyahaha〜♪ kidding, kiiidding. Did that catch you off guard? Thank~you~ for everything today.

I&#39;m a part of RYUSEITAI as RYUSEI Yellow~♪ On top of that, I’m also the chief head of the Ninja Association… And for the sake of becoming a splendid ninja, I strive to train hard every day! \nThe ninja fortune I got this morning said that if I completely master making ninja meals, I’ll have good luck coming my way! I’m a sucker for sour foods, so I’ll make a new ninja dish with my prized umeboshi! \nRight then, I’ve got to carry out a mission Isara-dono requested of me, so I shall take my leave! Shutatatata…!\n\nMidori Takamine\n\nAh, hello… I&#39;m Midori Takamine from RYUSEITAI. I, well... I accidentally took the idol course exam and passed it for some reason… Then Morisawa-senpai invited me to RYUSEITAI, and he insisted that I join the Basketball Club too, since I had the &quot;height&quot; apparently… \nLike, for some reason, he&#39;s always getting involved with me to a suffocating degree… Sigh, this is so depressing. I wanna die… \nBut I have the day off from both unit and club activities today, so I&#39;m thinking of going to my favorite yuruchara cafe. They&#39;ve got pizza on the menu... Here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s got basil on top...♪ \nUgh— I think I hear Morisawa-senpai&#39;s voice from over that side. I have to escape before he catches me…\n\nKuro Kiryu\n\nYo. I’m Kuro Kiryu, captain of the karate club. I’m also the second in command of AKATSUKI, a Japanese-themed unit. Though, sayin’ “I’m an idol” with this sorta face isn’t all that believable, is it?\nMy favorite bite ta eat? Gotta be steak. I always hafta eat meat before every match ‘n live performance to fire myself up. \nBut the other day, my lil’ sister just about threw a fit ‘cuz I ended up eatin’ too much of it… I want my lil’ sis to get her nutrition, so I try to keep that balance, but I accidentally end up bein’ careless about it when it comes to my own meals.\nWell, time I get back to makin’ the outfits for our next live soon. This was a nice change of pace. Thanks.\n\nSouma Kanzaki\n\nSouma Kanzaki has arrived! I am affiliated with AKATSUKI, the distinguished powerhouse unit of Yumenosaki Academy.

H-Hasumi-dono!? That’s right, today was unit practice. I am deeply sorry! I will apologize for this mistake with seppuku…! \n\nTetora Nagumo\n\nOssu! I’m a first-year student in the Karate Club. The name’s Tetora Nagumo, and I’m Ryusei Black in RYUSEITAI! My hobby’s workin’ out, and I respect Taishou tons! Ah– By Taishou, I’m talkin’ about Kiryu-senpai. He’s a third-year, and he’s like, a totally amazing person!\nI aim to be a man among men just like Taishou! I gotta get strong and cool like him as soon as I possibly can, so today’s another day I give everything my all. \nI’m gonna give my studies, my idol activities and my club activities everything I got! That’s why I’ll eat tons’a meat too, my favorite! Men grow stronger by eating meat!\nThat reminds me— Yesterday, Taishou told me that the kalbi meal set came back.

Click for more information\n  \n  \n  AKATSUKI is a unit embodied by 和 (wa, lit. harmony, but also a self-designator for Japan). The word 和風 (wafu, Japanese style) comes from 和. During the Meiji Restoration, 和 was central to Japan’s efforts to unify and assimilate new territories under a shared cultural identity. On top of his membership, Ibuki's active pursuit of 本当の和風 (true Japanese-style) being the reason he pursues AKATSUKI is inappropriate, bearing this in mind.\n  \n     Additionally, the Ryukyu Disposition was driven by military interests, particularly securing Japan's southern borders from other nations. In Okinawan schools, national pride was linked to serving Japan’s military goals. This had devastating consequences, particularly during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. This in mind, having Ibuki join the self-proclaimed \"war unit\" is also inappropriate. \n  Read the full-length analysis here: Unpacking Shinsei (新生) AKATSUKI; An Extended Translation Note and Analysis.\n\n\n(1/6) Keito\n\n... Hm? Anzu? Why are you here...\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry for waking you up&quot;? Ahh, no. I see, it seems I completely fell asleep here.\n\nThere&#39;s no need to apologize. If anything, I&#39;m grateful you woke me up.\n\n\n    \n        \n            What's that book...?\n        \n        \n            Ahh, it&#39;s something I&#39;d bought at a bookstore. I was thinking it would help with putting together projects.\nIt's recommended that we do livestreaming here at the MEGASPHERE, but I'm not really familiar with it.\n            \n            I&#39;m just learning the basics from it for now. The book touches on subjetcs like choosing a topic for the stream, the filiming environment, all that. It&#39;s been a very useful resource.\n            \n\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Pretty darn tired, huh?\n        \n        \n           A little.

What business could you possibly have with me?\n\n&quot;You seemed profoundly nervous, so I just came over to talk to you&quot;? Forgive me. It seems I caused you to worry.\n\n\n    \n        \n            What's the matter?\n        \n        \n            No, it&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s just that when I become conscientious of the &quot;mega-su-fee-a&quot; again, I become a little uneasy.\nIt is easy to forget when you are going about your day here, but looking out at the scenery from above makes you remember you're up in the sky.\n                I feel the same about airplanes. I tend to fret over what one would do if it were to fall out of the sky.\n\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Could you have a fear of heights, maybe?\n        \n        \n            Mnmm! I&#39;m not particularly bad with high places, but I&#39;m a little bad with machinery.\nBecause of that, I don't really have much faith in this \"mega-su-fee-a\". What would I do if it crashed? It makes me uneasy...\n                Hmm. There&#39;s a proper evacuation route when that happens? If you say so, that puts me a little more at ease.\n\n        \n    \n\n(3/6) Kuro\n\n... Oh, Lil&#39; Miss? What&#39;re you doin&#39; here?\nYa came to take a breather--- you&#39;re still workin&#39; huh? Thanks for your hard work, keepin&#39; at it this late at night.\n\nHm? What about me? Yeah, well, same thing. I got motion sick &#39;n couldn&#39;t sleep.\n\n\n    \n        \n            I've got some antisickness medicine if you need it.\n        \n        \n            Nah, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s more like a feeling than actual sickness.\n\n                I heard Kanzaki yammerin&#39; on about if the MEGASPHERE crashed during the day.\nNow that I'm sayin' it, I just remembered this is a vehicle, I'm sick. What a miserable conversation.\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Motion sickness?\n        \n        \n            Yeah. Look, this here so-called &quot;MEGASPHERE&quot; is just like a vehicle isn&#39;t it?\n\n                When the wind rocks the ship a lil&#39;, it feels like you&#39;re on a plane.\nStill, when ya go about yer day, it's just like livin' on the ground, so I guess it's not a problem.\n        \n    \n\n(4/6) Ibuki\n\nOoh~!

However, when Souma uses katakana words, they are all written in hiragana instead, likely to emphasize how he struggles with foreign words. These words are kept as written in hiragana, and put in &quot;quotes&quot;. Souma uses 段ぼぉる (ダンボール; danbo-ru) here (cardboard box) but I localized the translation to say ka-do bo-do (カードボール).↑ Though Keito calls it a gravure shoot (グラビア), it's not the typical risqué kind. This kind of shoot is more like a stylish photoshoot that highlights the model in a cool way. Here's an example."},{"title":"Bright Live Up!

This in mind, having Ibuki join the self-proclaimed \"war unit\" is also inappropriate. \n  Read the full-length analysis here: Unpacking Shinsei (新生) AKATSUKI; An Extended Translation Note and Analysis.\n\n⦿ Edits may be made to the lyrics translation after the event comes out: the story will likely give context to these lines.\n \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    Characters\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\n                \n                \n                \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Event\n                \n                \n                    TBD\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Translation\n                \n                \n                    citrinesea\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                   Proofreading\n                \n                \n                    mika_enstars, 310mc\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\nPlease check Translation Notes for more details and Interpretation Notes if you want some personal thoughts of mine.\n\n\n  \n    Voice\n    Line\n    Time\n  \n  \n    Keito\n    Black?

The song has a sense of unity, so for most of it, I chose to use \"we\" or keep it vague for the time being.\n⦿ Ibuki consistently mentions he was \"born in Okinawa and raised in America\". The use of English and some of the wasei-eigo terms like (Fill-in) フィルイン being used in English feels like Ibuki's influence in the song.\n⦿ On top of the shared 月 kanji, KAGETSU being capitalized like AKATSUKI gives it this added feel that AKATSUKI’S DNA is in it.\n⦿ The song 百花繚乱、紅月夜  (Hyakkaryoran Akatsukiyo; A Thousand Blossoms, the Night of Crimson Moon) takes a very prominent focus in VS☆AUDIENCE for Keito and Ibuki's storyline. The 華 (ka; flowers/splendor) in KAGETSU feels related to the Hyakkaryoran. Additionally, in Tenshou KAGETSU, Ibuki sings \"We must find freedom\". The theme of freedom is directly connected to Hyakkaryoran as well.\nFrom VS☆AUDIENCE, Hundred 11:\n“Yesterday, the audience was composed of a hundred idol enthusiasts, so they were relatively favorable to you all. However, this might not be the case going forward—”\n&quot;The audience for the second day will be composed of… “music enthusiasts” !”\n“You must all gain the favor of one hundred music enthusiasts!”\n“The first theme you will attempt is “freedom” —”\n“You can use any means necessary, so I expect a great fight from you all…♪”\n\n. . .\nHasumi-san! I’m all set and ready to go~♪\nI’ll be playing the guitar, so you follow my lead!\nWe’ll do an AKATSUKI song of course...♪\n♪! ♪! ♪!\n\nWha!? He’s already beginning to perform…!\n(Free and unconventional, but somehow it sticks in your mind...)\nIt couldn’t be… you’re playing… “A Thousand Blossoms, the Night of Crimson Moon”, aren’t you?\n\n⦿ Personal Interpretation: For the section beneath EDM Break 2, I have two opposing personal interpretations (which honestly speaks to the breadth of the song, and will probably be more clear when the story comes out). 1. AKATSUKI's appraisals of Ibuki performing with them on stage as a collaborator, and 2. Each of Ibuki, Kuro, and Souma's personal journeys as idols.\n\nIbuki's line stays the same in both interpretations: &quot;A thunderous chorus scattering a sharp Pride that’s exclusively mine&quot; = performing on stage in such a powerful manner is shaking him into realizing what he wants to be as an idol.\nKuro's line: &quot;The value of choice is yours for the taking&quot; = 1. Telling Ibuki that his fate is up to him, and he's in a good position to decide what he wants to do with his own autonomy OR 2. Reflecting on his choice to take matters in his own hands and live an honest life to become an idol (Meteor Impact).\nSouma's line: &quot;A will that has bloomed in recognition within the endless, suspended crimson&quot; = 1. In VS☆AUDIENCE, Souma says this:\n\nMmm… It’s certainly true that Hasumi-dono seems to be getting a considerable amount of “su-ku-reen-taimu” because of that scoundrel, but…\nI haven’t recognized Taki quite yet.\nI will see what kind of fate the upcoming audition has in store for Hasumi-dono and Taki from here on out, until the very end!\n\n\nFor Interpretation 1, this is Souma recognizing Ibuki's will that's bloomed within crimson OR 2. Reflecting on his own will that has been recognized. In a flashback in Shinsengumi, Souma enters AKATSUKI after challenging every test Keito gives him, eventually wearing him down. This could also be a &quot;recognized&quot; will that bloomed within crimson.\n\nKeito watching from the shadows and only emerging from the light to prompt them to start their solos represents the fact he took them in along their journeys.\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Also known as drum fills.↑ In English.↑ KAGETSU, 華月.

Ah, that’s too insolent of me to say, when I am still only a novice… I’ll say “thank you for your hard work” instead～♪\nCome now, enjoy the food to your heart&#39;s content.\nThe food used in the banquet scene is authentic. It would be a waste to let it rot and get thrown away, so I was told they’d like us to finish it up.\nI hurried to get some additional food and drinks, so let&#39;s have a quick kick-off and enjoy ourselves~♪\nOh, by the way, we have permission to have a wrap-up party here.\nThe sponsors were very happy that Scroll of the Elements was a great success~♪\n\nHow are you so energetic, Kanzaki...? I&#39;m completely exhausted.\nIt was a slapstick comedy this time around, so my face hurts from overusing facial muscles that don’t typically get practice.\n\nYeah, what he said. My face got so stiff that it isn’t goin’ back to normal...\nPlus, the focus was on sword-fighting and action scenes for this performance. Kanzaki and I are fine for the most part, but Hasumi-no-danna, are you feelin’ groggy from it all?\n\nDon’t look down on me. I don&#39;t want to hold you guys back, so I go on runs to train.\nIt feels good to run early in the morning. I can feel the change of seasons, too.\n\nThat makes you sound like a grandpa…\nWell done to everyone in RYUSEITAI, too. We were in sync way more than I expected, and it was pretty fun. Let&#39;s perform together again~♪\n\nI should be the one to say that to you guys. We got to experience something extremely valuable, and thanks to you all, Scroll of the Elements was made possible.\nThank you for making my comrade’s dreams come true.\n\nHmph. It&#39;s still autumn, it would be bad if you burnt out here.\nThe organizers said that if things keep going like this, they would like to consider holding additional performances or releasing a second round... There may also be an opportunity to do a similar live in the future.\n\ni’m looking forward to it~ next time, i want to play the role of [samurai-san], too~\nthe other day, souma taught me how to use a [katana]~♪1\n\nIt’s risky to let Buchou-dono handle blades, so I’d rather he doesn’t, but…\nI&#39;ve grown a little interested in ninjas, too. Why don&#39;t you teach me the basics next time, Sengoku?\n\nZzz… zzz…~♪\n\nOh, Sengoku fell asleep. He must be exhausted, he sleeps like a baby... He worked hard today, after all~♪\n\nAhaha. Yet on stage, or rather, in the final scene, he looked so powerful and cool.\nHe actually genuinely managed to pass through the ring of fire. It was a real surprise to see.\n\nHe really is light on his feet, huh... Tetora:-kun is pretty athletic, too — I feel like I’m the only one who looks like a dunce...\nMaybe I&#39;m lanky because I only eat vegetables… I need to take in more protein...\n\nOh, you got so inspired by your comrades that it made you wish to grow stronger!? Takamine is a boy too, huh~ That feeling is important!\nThat’s wonderful! Keep encouraging each other to improve yourselves, you guys...☆\n\nWait— please don&#39;t cling to me... Right after performances, Morisawa-senpai’s body-temperature is about three times higher than normal, and it’s so stuffy...\n\nIt’s fine, isn’t it? Let’s get along! Let&#39;s share our happiness!\nNow that Sengoku has done what he wants to do, it might be Takamine&#39;s turn next, y’know? Is there anything you want to do?\n\nUu~... Right now, I just want to go home and sleep in bed...\n\nWhat a silly comedy this is, like Manjuu Kowai.2 Alright, that’s all from me. I’ll take my leave now, so onto the next speaker.\n\nEpilogue 2\n\n… Anzu-dono, you’re standing a little far away for some reason, but…\nYou should come closer. Here, the chestnut yokan is delicious~♪\n…You have such a sad look on your face. What’s the matter? If you’d like, you can talk to me.\nWe’re “kurasumeito”, I want you to rely on me anytime~♪\nHmm. You feel disappointed in yourself because you misjudged what distance to take with us “aidoru”?\nSengoku told you that he was neither a stuffed animal nor a younger brother... And you feel bad about that?\nI think Sengoku said that simply because he wanted to be treated as a man, though.\nJust doting on someone isn&#39;t enough to satisfy that.\nIt’s a difficult problem, isn’t it? We have our respective positions, but we’re human beings with flesh and blood. We aren’t mature enough to be capable of completely separating work and private life.\nA novice like me shouldn’t say something haughty, but... We are humans, Anzu-dono. You will inevitably make mistakes, over and over again.\nHowever, in this modern age, it isn’t such a suffocating era that even a single mistake cannot be forgiven until after one’s death...\nIt’s alright to make mistakes many times over, and to regret them just as much. After all, the most important thing is not to repeat them again, correct?\nIn hopes that next time nobody will get hurt — That hopefully, you can come closer to crafting a better future…\nYou have no choice but to put in the effort, reflect on yourself, and fumble your way forward. Fortunately, in this modern age... For kids like us, there is a “next time” waiting for us.\nWe were born in a happy era, not in the harsh Sengoku period — a period where, even if you stole nothing but a handful of rice, your hands would be cut off, or you would be killed...\nAs long as we’re allowed to make mistakes, and until the moment we use up all of my &quot;next times&quot;... there is nothing we can do but to make every effort we can until we become adults.\nCarrying sins, mistakes, and scars, we have no choice but to grow so that we won&#39;t repeat them again.\nMm? Ahh, I’m simply echoing Hasumi-dono&#39;s words. He told me something like that when we first met...\nThere was something about it that really touched me, and that is why I&#39;m still by his side to this day.\nThat person has made mistakes and failed many times, but he still does all he can to keep moving forward. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same for Kiryu-dono.\nThat’s exactly why I want to serve and honor my seniors.\n… Sorry, I wanted to listen to your worries, Anzu-dono, but I only ended up talking about myself.\nBut, well, understanding us “aidoru” to a deep level is never a waste for a “prodyusaa”.\nAnzu-dono. I want you to smile. Everyone will worry if you look so gloomy. Plenty of our “kurasumeito” are nosey.\nLet’s go back to where everyone is. If you feel anxious, I will protect you. You have an attendant by your side.\nTo be frank… Out of AKATSUKI and RYUSEITAI, I’m the only second-year.\nIf Anzu-dono weren’t here with me, I’d constantly have to grapple with being stuck between my juniors and seniors. Ha ha ha~♪\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ A reference to Crash Course, where members from different units trained together by swapping out their aesthetics.

We’ve been seeing a lot of each other at “Gaaden Terasu” as of late, huh? Are you also having lunch?\nMm, food and health are inextricably linked.\nI want you to eat a lot, get healthy, and produce us idols relentlessly…♪\nAs usual, I’m putting on the act as a chef. If you’d like, let me serve you some homemade food.\nAlso, I had so much fun chopping up the ingredients that I ended up preparing a lot of them...♪\nHm, that&#39;s what you intended? Because you want to save food costs? Hm, then there’s no need for my concern. Transfer Student-dono is such a strong woman!\n\n\n Splendid, bravo~♪ If you&#39;re happy with my cooking, I’d like you to eat it to your heart&#39;s content. May it become a source of energy for you!\nDo you mind if I join you? It’s more pleasant to eat with a group~♪ Mm. Excuse me…\nHold on a moment. This is too much for one person to eat, but not enough for two people. Let’s finish cooking a little bit more.\nDo you have any “reku-ests”? I’m getting tired of always eating seafood. I have some premium meat that Adonis-dono gave me, so maybe I’ll have that for t—…\nHuh? — A scoundrel!\n\nEyaaa?! Wh-Wh– Why did a table get cut to pieces in front of me?!\n\n\nI-I– I&#39;m definitely not a suspicious person! If you could just spare me my life…?!\n\nHm, who are you? What do you intend to do by sneaking around on the floor, you dodgy fellow?\nAre you a thief? You lawless cad! For the sake of &quot;Gaaden Terasu&quot;, this Kanzaki Souma will inflict punishment upon you!\n\nW-Wait a second! Why is this person wielding a Japanese sword as if it’s normal? This is a violation of the Firearms and Swords Act2!\n\nHmm, you are... I believe you are Sengoku from the Ninja Association. You. Are you acting suspicious again?\nGood grief, it’s a complete nuisance. For some reason, people seem to think you’re close friends with me.\n\nHuh, why? I&#39;m the type of ninja who doesn&#39;t have many close friends, though…\nBut it’s not that I can&#39;t make friends because I’m shy! Ninjas are like shadows, destined to live by erasing all traces of their very presence...!\n\nHmm. I’m samurai-like. You’re ninja-like. The public seems to think that samurai and ninja are birds of a feather.\n\nEhh!? Ninjas and samurai are completely different! But there were some ninjas who became feudal lords, so I guess it depends on the character of the region?\nAnd um, Kanzaki-dono is more of a “swordsman” than a “samurai”, right?\n\nWell, I&#39;m not interested in the distinction. However, the problem is that you and I are considered to be compatriots.\nWhenever you do something strange, I get frowned upon, too. It’s better to live a more straightforward life, more pure and honest.\nIf you live right, instead of crawling around on the floor like that, you&#39;ll be able to face the sun with pride.\n\n\nF-For some reason, I'm being scolded... Uu~? But I can’t relax in bright places, y’know~…?\n… What on earth have you been doing since a while ago? You can eat while sitting on a chair. Ninjas seem like they’re completely unfamiliar with etiquette.\nIf you&#39;re hungry, I&#39;ll share some of my food with you.\n\nYaaay, I&#39;ve graduated from eating by myself~!\nAh, Transfer Student-dono was here too! I wonder if I&#39;ve interrupted your date...?\n\nWe’re simply “kurasumeito”. We just so happened to share a table today. Now that’s enough, it&#39;s time to eat. It&#39;s said that nausea dwells in an empty stomach.\n\nThank you, thank you...! I was running out of food allowance this month. Honestly, I was in trouble.\nAlso, here in Garden Terrace... I was doing a little fly-catching.\n\n\nWell, now that I see it closely, it’s flypaper! You— Don&#39;t show those things while we’re eating! It’s unsanitary, I&#39;ll lose my appetite!\nAre you going to eat it? Do you eat flies? As I thought, I can&#39;t understand ninjas...!\n\nHey, please don&#39;t draw your sword?! I’m not going to eat them~! These flies are meant to be frog food.\n\nFr-Frogs? Are you raising them as pets?\n\nThey’re more like friends than pets to raise~ Ninjas use dogs, birds, frogs, and the like.\nBut dogs bite, and birds nip with their beaks, so frogs are the best ones to get along with.\nHowever, they&#39;re bigger eaters than they look. The cost of food is ridiculous, so that’s why I catch flies myself, if that makes sense...?\n\nI-I see. That’s why you set foot for “Gaaden Terasu”. Certainly, those types of insects tend to gather in the dining hall.\n\nThat’s right~ Oops, found another fly! I&#39;ll capture it~☆\n\nDon&#39;t mess around while you’re eating! Have you no manners!\n\nForgive me a million times over, but I&#39;m seriously in trouble. I can&#39;t let my frogs go hungry...\nI&#39;m starving because I&#39;m cutting back on my own food expenses. Ninjas and samurai alike cannot fight if they are hungry.\nSo please give me your patience— hm hm! There are flies again~☆\n\nHey, that&#39;s annoying! Besides, flies have compound eyes. They have excellent dynamic vision, so you can&#39;t catch them with movements like that! Watch!\nEn garde–!3\n\nOoh, you caught a fly with chopsticks! That’s amazing...☆\n\n\nHehe. I don&#39;t try to pretend I’m as skilled as the ancient swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, but... for a well-trained martial artist, a target such as this is a breeze before breakfast. Ha! Take that! And that4!\n\nWow, that’s amazing! I want you to catch more, and I want you to teach me how to do it, too~♪\n\nHeh, I don&#39;t hate being praised. But my training will be severe, you know.\n\nBring it on! Enduring all hardships is what makes a ninja—...\nOw?!\n\n\nOgh?! Wh-Why are you hitting us, Transfer Student-dono!\nHuh, “Don&#39;t fool around while eating”...? That&#39;s right, this ninja managed to get me carried away!\n\nIs it my fault?!\nBut well, I certainly don&#39;t think it would be a good idea to play with flies while we eat! Forgive me, Transfer Student-dono!\n\nHehe. Sengoku, you also call Transfer Student-dono &quot;Transfer Student-dono&quot;, huh?\nIt gives off the impression that we are samurai and ninja who serve the same master, so what say you and I get along better from now on?\n\nI&#39;m so happy! Yaaay, I&#39;ve made a new friend... ♪ Transfer Student-dono brought us together!\nI’m so thankful, I should call you “Lord&quot;5 instead of “Transfer Student-dono”! You are our master, Lord!\n\nLord, why have you stopped eating? Come come, eat as much as you like～♪\n\nLord～♪\n\nLord～☆\n\n\n...Ow?! You hit me again! I suppose you’d rather be called “Princess” instead of “Lord”?\n\nHmm, a girl&#39;s heart is complicated...\nSengoku, if you&#39;re having trouble finding food for your frogs, come to the Marine Life Club room later. We may have some food stocked up, so I&#39;ll lend you a little.\n\nUwaa, that&#39;d save me trouble! But it&#39;s cool to catch flies with chopsticks too. I&#39;d be happy if you could teach me how to do it later~♪\nEhehe, I had a really fun lunchtime today! I am terribly grateful~♪\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ -殿 (-dono) is an honorific that roughly means &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;.

Click for more information\n  \n  \n  AKATSUKI is a unit embodied by 和 (wa, lit. harmony, but also a self-designator for Japan). The word 和風 (wafu, Japanese style) comes from 和. During the Meiji Restoration, 和 was central to Japan’s efforts to unify and assimilate new territories under a shared cultural identity. On top of his membership, Ibuki's active pursuit of 本当の和風 (true Japanese-style) being the reason he pursues AKATSUKI is inappropriate, bearing this in mind.\n  \n     Additionally, the Ryukyu Disposition was driven by military interests, particularly securing Japan's southern borders from other nations. In Okinawan schools, national pride was linked to serving Japan’s military goals. This had devastating consequences, particularly during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. This in mind, having Ibuki join the self-proclaimed \"war unit\" is also inappropriate. \n  Read the full-length analysis here: Unpacking Shinsei (新生) AKATSUKI; An Extended Translation Note and Analysis.\n\nSet Sail 12\n\n    Season: Summer\n\n\n    A while later, in the livestreaming studio in the Mega Sphere Tower. Rhythm Link Unit Joint Livestream.\n\n\n&quot;Can everyone watching hear me?&quot;\n&quot;We, the idols of RhythLin, will now be hosting a livestream to introduce ourselves to one another.&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me start by introducing our agency.&quot;\n&quot;At our agency, one with a long-established presence in the entertainment industry—&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, come on, Hasumi-san! Loosen up a little, &#39;kay~?&quot;\n\"This is just a chill stream, right~? You’re being way too serious~!\"\n&quot;Hm... I see.&quot;\n\n&quot;The audience took the time to watch our stream. We better get to the point quick.&quot;\n\n&quot;It is a trend that prioritizes time and cost effectiveness1, after all.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmm. I don’t get streaming culture at all, but let’s start with introductions for the first-time viewers.&quot;\n&quot;We are the Japanese-style unit AKATSUKI.&quot;\n&quot;We are a unit that strives to honor tradition while staying open to new culture.&quot;\n\n&quot;Our leader is Hasumi Keito. I’m Kiryu Kuro, and—&quot;\n\n&quot;I am Kanzaki Souma.&quot;\n\n\"Hold it~ Kanzaki-san, that’s where you stop~? I’m a member of AKATSUKI too, right~? Go back and do it again right!\"\n&quot;Gh, forgive me! I sat and rehearsed it in my head extensively beforehand, and yet did this during the actual stream!&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Let me introduce you to everyone. This is Taki Ibuki. He recently joined AKATSUKI as our fourth member.&quot;\n\n&quot;Taki Ibuki, stepping up to the plate! I’m an idol with roots in both Japan and the U.S.~♪&quot;\n&quot;I came to find &quot;true Japanese-style&quot; in AKATSUKI,2 so be sure to send us lots of “Nice!”s too~☆&quot;\n\n&quot;What’s this “true Japanese-style” you’re going on about? Are there fake ones or what?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nyahaha~ That’s pretty insensitive, y’know Oogami-san? Some important things can’t be put into words~♪&quot;\n\n&quot;Haahn...&quot;\n&quot;So what you’re saying is, it’s rock ’n roll, huh~!&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Hold it. That explanation didn’t really cut it. I think the viewers are pretty lost.&quot;\n\n&quot;What don’t you get about it— this romance!&quot;\n\nCirculation 3\n\n    Meanwhile, in the studio after the \"Rhythm Link Joint Broadcast\" has ended.\n\n\n(Sigh) ... Damn, I can&#39;t do this~...\n\nWhat&#39;s the matter, Ogami?\nWeren&#39;t you the one who borrowed a guitar from the equipment room, and offered to stay and help clean after the stream? Changed your mind already?\n\nNah, that&#39;s not it~\nI just don&#39;t get why we got dragged up into the sky and told to stream.\n\nHm. You don&#39;t like streaming?\n\nI dunno if I&#39;d say I don&#39;t like it...\nUp &#39;til now, the outcome was always decided through live shows, and now suddenly we&#39;re forced to stream— how the hell am I supposed to keep up?! Feels like a total nightmare, doesn&#39;t it!?\n\nOgami. So you feel the same way...\n\nHm? You feel that way too, Bastard Glasses?\n\nI can&#39;t say this too loud, but honestly, I&#39;m completely thrown too.\nAKATSUKI had just resolved to carve our own path, so the invasion of the Mega Sphere was a complete blindside.\nA joint stream seemed like a good way to assess the situation, but this is uncharted territory for me.\n\nTaki and I had passed the audition in 4piece, but even Kanzaki seemed bewildered by the livestreaming aspect.\nMaybe forcing ourselves into a structure helped keep us a little calmer, right?\n\nTch, so that&#39;s what you were scheming. Guess you fooled me~ I thought you were actually hyped for this thing.\n\nStill. Glad I&#39;m not the only one stuck in this nightmare.\nI definitely thought no one else but me was havin&#39; doubts about this Mega Sphere thing~\n\nDon’t be ridiculous. You think I’m not affected?\n\nWe have ways to mask our true feelings, especially for something like a 24-hour livestream. And with the audience watching, we can’t always speak freely, right?\nEven an outspoken guy like you clammed up during the stream. That&#39;s how stifling it is.\n\nThat&#39;s my problem is all, I just didn&#39;t want to hold the RhythLin guys back.\n\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen it yourself too. Human psychology is complicated.\n\nWell, sooner or later, every idol will voice their real thoughts.\nJust going with the arrangements to a T is boring in and of itself. It should come to a point where the true nature of idols will be tested.\n\nTheir true nature will be tested... well, isn&#39;t that interesting?\n\nFrom now on, I&#39;m not gonna go along with things nice and obedient. Whatever happens, treatin’ it like a battle will put me at ease ♪\n\nRight. Getting to face off against the Four Kings of the Heavens would be the best you could ask for as a result.\n\nThat&#39;s a nightmare on its own.\nThe Sphere Live is cool~ so I wanna have a go at that, but... Sakuma-senpai&#39;s got the nerve to just push the story forward by himself. That guy&#39;s just too tough to deal with.\n\nI&#39;m sure Rei-kun had his reasons, hm?\n\n\nThe hell? When&#39;d you get here, Hakaze-senpai?\nEavesdropping&#39;s real low of you, y&#39;know~ How about you come over and help us, huh?\n\nSorry, sorry. You were late, so I got curious!\nStill, please don&#39;t criticize Rei too much now. In fact, it seems like the Four Kings of the Heavens were founded pretty abruptly, right?\n\nHaaah? How do you know about that, Hakaze-senpai?\n\nI was there when Rei-kun got the email from NiceP, inviting him.\n\nHahh? If that was the case, you shoulda said somethin&#39; more about it. Why&#39;s this coming up now...!\n\nHeheh. Don&#39;t get so fired up, Koga-kun. I don&#39;t really get what NiceP&#39;s intentions are with us.\nHe really did get the email from Nice, but I couldn&#39;t see what was in it.\nRei-kun didn&#39;t even know about the Four Kings of the Heavens until right before the Mega Sphere was unveiled to everyone.\n\nTch, seems like something that rainbow suit would do.\n\nLosing Sakuma is a huge hit for UNDEAD, but you&#39;re doing alright?\n\nYeah. We can&#39;t just rely on Rei-kun, after all. The three of us will manage someway.\n\nRight? Koga-kun?\n\nDon&#39;t just decide that on your own~\n\nWell, whatever. I don&#39;t like this whole streaming thing~ but I&#39;ll prove we&#39;re the strongest, Sakuma-senpai or not.\nI&#39;ve got no plans of sucking up to the audience, but I&#39;ll earn the right to the Sphere Live my own way.\n\nWe may be opponents, but I&#39;m rooting for you. Oogami, Hakaze.\nWe were only able to do self-introductions on the joint stream. From here on out, we&#39;ll need to show more of our individuality.\n\nNaturally, that goes for us AKATSUKI too.\nIf being chosen as the Six Selected by Song is what makes you the victor, then I intend to fight by those rules as well.\n\nCirculation 7\n\n    Livestream: Learning how to Sword Dance!\n\n\nMenso~re, everyone ♪3 Let's start today's stream~♪\n\nThis time around, the theme is &quot;Sword Dancing&quot;! Instructor Kanzaki-san&#39;s gonna teach us all sortsa things~♪\n\nThat&#39;s right. Taki, watch my example.\nBefore anything else, you should always treat a sword you handle as if it were real, no matter the type.\nIf you get complacent and treat it like a mere replica, the blade will feel that spirit and mirror it. It won&#39;t be able to demonstrate it&#39;s true potential—\n\n(... It&#39;s refreshing watching Kanzaki lecture Taki.)\n(It was always me and Kiryu who were the ones showing Kanzaki how to do things.)\n\n(Taki joining us has caused some pretty big changes around here, though—)\n(Unfortunately, we haven&#39;t been getting as many &quot;Nice!&quot;s as we thought we would.)\n(In a way, it feels like poetic justice for the days of Yumenosaki.)\n\n(The DreFes system was devised for the sake of victory for Eichi and the Student Council.)\n(For Live Showdowns, the winner was determined by the votes of the audience. The rules of those DreFes&#39;s were plain and simple.)\n(At the same time, it was easy to reflect what we wanted through the ways we did production and advertising.)\n\n(Back then, the way the rules were set up benefitted us, but now, it&#39;s the complete opposite.)\n(We don&#39;t know who is watching, or where they&#39;re watching from. Whatever they might be interested in is a mystery.)\n(Since we moved to the stage of ES, we&#39;ve had to adapt beyond lives to dramas and variety shows too.)\n(When it comes to the Mega Stream, there is no one right answer.)\n\n(My streams are especially hopeless.)\n(If it&#39;s a matter of competing on established theory, I&#39;d win over just about anyone, but—)\n(It&#39;s just like I thought, I&#39;m sure my personality isn&#39;t suited for streaming at all.)\n\nWhat&#39;s with the long face, Danna.4 Your brows are creasing.\n\nKiryu? How&#39;s the stream going?\n\nRight, Kanzaki&#39;s got it this time around so it should be fine.\nWell, we are being broadcast 24 hours a day, so we&#39;re gonna get broadcast whether we like it or not.\n\nThat&#39;s right. There&#39;s no backing out now.\n\nNot to change the subject, but Kiryu. Are you okay with your motion sickness?\nYou seemed calm yesterday too. Don’t tell me you’ve overcome it?\n\nWell. As long as I don&#39;t go near the edge of the Mega Sphere and look over it.\nMakes it feel like mega huge island that floats. It&#39;s extendin&#39; from the ground. After that, it&#39;s just a matter of how it feels.\n\nSo you&#39;re deluding yourself... It&#39;s better than being out of commission, I suppose.\nThings are going just how you thought they would. The streaming isn&#39;t going well.\n\nHaha, so that&#39;s what you were worrying about? ♪\nIf we&#39;re gonna do it, we&#39;re gonna try &#39;n win, but there&#39;s nothin&#39; at stake for us if we lose, right?\nEven if the streams are floppin&#39;, you don&#39;t gotta be so despondent about it, right?\n\nWell, unless you&#39;ve gone blind with greed and wanna take the influence of the Four Heavenly Kings. That might be a different story...♪\n\nHmph. I can see right through the bait, I&#39;m not engaging with it.\nIt&#39;s not that I want influence, but it&#39;s not something simple either. It&#39;s about AKATSUKI now, specfically.\n\nWe went against the agency&#39;s wishes and made the extreme move of accepting Taki into the unit.5\nIt was one made to keep AKATSUKI from stagnating and to invest in Taki&#39;s potential, but if AKATSUKI gets completely crushed here at the Mega Sphere, how will that go for Taki?\nI imagine unfounded slander will come his way, and he&#39;ll bear the blame of throwing the trinity of AKATSUKI6, the trinity that was whole and complete, out of order.\n\nI think you&#39;re overthinking things.\nAnywho, it was a fateful meeting, right? So as long as we approve of Taki, it&#39;s fine, isn&#39;t it?\n\n... But, well. I get what you&#39;re thinkin&#39;, Danna.\nYou wanna win in streamin&#39; to give the reborn AKATSUKI7 some momentum.\nAt the rate things are goin&#39; right now, that&#39;s not gonna happen, huh. That&#39;s what it is.\n\nThat&#39;s right. We need to play to win, even in this new, raging current we&#39;re in. It wouldn&#39;t be AKATSUKI otherwise.\n\nI don&#39;t really want to, but maybe I should ask Eichi for some tips on streaming...\nIt seems like fine&#39;s been in good shape, even with the streaming, so there might be something to learn there.\n\nStay away from Tenshouin. He&#39;s gonna need to collect the hairs of your butt as collateral by the time he&#39;s done with you.8\nOr how &#39;bout this, whenever he gets the chance, he&#39;s gonna rub that in your face &#39;til who knows when.\n\nThen, I need another example to follow.\nSakuma— Well, I&#39;d learn completely different strategies from the Four Kings of the Heavens. If only there were other people to choose from.\n\n...\n\nIsn&#39;t that... Akehoshi?\n\nLooks like it. He&#39;s usually pretty composed, right? He got motion sickness or somethin&#39;?\n\nNo way, He&#39;s not like you, there&#39;s probably a different reason.\nIf I had to guess, it could be from the firestorm online yesterday.\n\nFirestorm?\n\nYeah. He&#39;d said something harsh to Esu, so it became a big problem on social media.\n\nWhat? What&#39;d he say that got him the heat?\nI&#39;m sayin&#39; that, but power harrassment is all over the place in the world of delinquents, y&#39;know? ♪\n\nWell, people have been saying the entertainment industry needs to have harrassment training lately. It&#39;s not somethin&#39; to take very lightly, right?\n\nRight. Because whether or not it&#39;s power harrassment is determined by the point of view of the victim.\nPutting aside what social media thinks, what matters is the way Esu perceived the interaction.\n\n... Or such, but even if you use a sound argument, it doesn&#39;t do anything to temper the heat online.\nI&#39;m not going to just leave this up to being Akehoshi&#39;s problem. I&#39;ll go try reach out to him a little.\nAkehoshi. You&#39;re in the middle of an online firestorm right now, aren&#39;t you? Should you really be loafing around in a place like this?\n\nHuh~? You know about that already? Nothing gets past those sharp ears of yours alright~\nNaturally. Anyone could do that amount of intelligence gathering.\nThere&#39;s nothing to do in the Mega Sphere anyways, I had the time to kill.\n\nHmm. I see. So you know my stance on streaming as well, then.\nI was looking for anyone I can to collaborate with right now.\nYou know about RYUSEITAI&#39;s momentum, don&#39;t you?\n\nI do. They&#39;ve been able to make ginormous strides in the rankings, all the way up to the top.\nAs I recall, RYUSEITAI&#39;s momentum has got them on hot on the Four Kings&#39; heels— and they had a massive advantage to begin with.\n\nYeah. At this rate, I&#39;ll just end up getting left in the dust if I don&#39;t work hard.\nTo be honest, I wouldn&#39;t be able to take it if doing a collab leads to backlash like yesterday&#39;s. Still, wouldn&#39;t holing up in my room all day just be giving up to the entire thing?\n\nGiven all that, wanna do a collab together?\n\n\nWhat? A collaboration with me...?\nYou tend to rely on your unit at times like this, don&#39;t you? You&#39;re not going to do something with Trickstar?\n\nNah, they all got worried and asked me to stream with them. But, I turned them down.\nI guess you could say I&#39;m trying to protect my family or something?\n\nIs that so? ... Understood. I&#39;ll accept your offer.\nHowever, it&#39;ll be a collaboration with just me, not AKATSUKI.\nJust like how you want to keep Trickstar away from the flames, I don&#39;t want any of those sparks catching onto AKATSUKI.\n\nUntil I can handle streaming on my own, collaborations would be a great opportunity for me too.\nWhat kind of collaboration should we do? I don&#39;t really have a lot of topics to talk about. Could you give me a few suggestions?\n\nThat&#39;s what I figured ☆\nSo then. Things we can do for our stream.... What about talking about the things we like?\n\nThe things we like...?\n\nWe tried it for Esu&#39;s stream yesterday, and he got lots and lots of &quot;Nice!&quot;s when he was talking about adventuring.\nUkki~ wasn&#39;t really good at collabs, so he switched to streaming games. So, we should try talking about the things we like, right?\n\nSomething I like... There&#39;s certainly a whole lot of manga I could talk about.\nI could talk about my family&#39;s temple too, but it&#39;s pretty plain and I think it&#39;d be hard to get people interested in it. In that case—\n\nI&#39;ve got nothing left to suggest but glasses!\n\n... Of course, glasses? Glasses?!\n\nHow did that happen...!\n\nAfter all, there were glasses emojis fluttering everywhere during the joint lilvestream.\nWhy don&#39;t we try talking about my love for glasses, and go find a pair of frames that suits you best?\n\nWahoo~! Looking forward to working with ya, Hasumin-senpai!\n\nOi, Hasumi. Don&#39;t let Trickstar&#39;s enthusiasm be a bad influence on ya, &#39;kay...?\n\nTowing 3\n\n\n    The next day. AKATSUKI's Hasumi Keito, Mid-Stream\n\n&quot;So. how did you all like AKATSUKI&#39;s stream today?&quot;\n&quot;For the aftershow, I&#39;ll be streaming on my phone from here. It feels a bit odd being in this room all by myself, though.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hm? &quot;Your sutra chanting today was wonderful!&quot;...?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not used to such nice comments of praise. I just decided to try streaming the routine of the son of a temple, like sutra-chanting and zazen, but—&quot;\n&quot;Still. I didn&#39;t expect it to get this popular. Guess you don&#39;t know what trends might take off.&quot;\n\n&quot;Right. When I was doing a collaboration with Akehoshi, we caused an inconvenience for everyone in the audience.&quot;\n&quot;Everyone who was excited left enthusiastic comments, but those were all swept away by the toxic ones.&quot;\n\n&quot;I believe everyone here is sensible, so I have a favor to ask.&quot;\n&quot;Please stop bad-mouthing Akehoshi.&quot;\n&quot;I&#39;ve been at the other end of trivial, fabricated lies and unjustified slander too.&quot;\n&quot;&#39;The truth&#39; doesn&#39;t always exist in ways that are easy to understand.&quot;\n&quot;I&#39;ve heard that Akehoshi and Esu have a good relationship with each other, so it&#39;s not too late to wait and hear what Esu has to say himself, before making your minds up on it.&quot;\n&quot;That&#39;s not all. Not only did Akehoshi give me detailed advice about streaming, but he gave me all sorts of inspiration too.&quot;\n&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been streaming about the daily life of being a temple boy.&quot;\n&quot;It&#39;s hard to say I&#39;ve gotten tons of &quot;Nice!&quot;s coming in yet, but without him, I&#39;d still be shooting in the dark for something that works.&quot;\n&quot;If it interests you, please go and watch Akehoshi&#39;s stream too.&quot;\n&quot;I&#39;m thinking of asking him if he&#39;d collaborate with me again, so if and when that happens, I&#39;d love your support.&quot;\n\n\nThe rankings... Mn~n, the other idols have already gotten used to streaming, so I&#39;ve slid down pretty low in comparison.\nItsuki-senpai told me not to get caught up by just the &quot;Nice!&quot;s, but...\n\nM~nn... Is there anything else beyond &quot;Nice!&quot;s? I don&#39;t know.\n\nYou seem to be grappling with something, Akehoshi.\n\nOh— Hasumin-senpai.\nI saw it, y&#39;know. &quot;The Daily Life of a Temple Boy!&quot;\n\nSeems like you got tons of &quot;Nice!&quot;s from overseas viewers too, huh.\nWe&#39;re speaking Japanese, so how did this manage to catch on overseas~? Feels kinda funny.\n\nNiceP alluded to this on the livestream with Eichi, but it seems like they&#39;re using some kind of automatic machine translation.\nAnyways. I came by to thank you today.\n\nOh, you&#39;re fine, it&#39;s no biggie. What&#39;s there to thank me for?\nAll you did was bring out your own strengths, Hasumin-senpai.\nI had nothing to do with it, yeah?\n\nThat&#39;s not true. It&#39;s thanks to the collaboration you offered me.\nI felt pressured to deliver a good stream as the leader of AKATSUKI.\n\nI couldn&#39;t show Kiryu and the juniors I was panicking... but you inviting me to collaborate with you lifted a lot of that weight off my shoulders.\n\nI feel a little embarrassed when you praise me so much like that, Hasumin-senpai.\nYou used to get angry and yell at me for &quot;disrupting public morales&quot; or something, y&#39;know~?\n\nAnd back then, you were also another big problem child. Exactly how many times did I have to tell you not to run in the halls?\nThat wild streak is a vice— that much about you hasn&#39;t changed even now.\n\nYou turned down Morisawa&#39;s offer. So you&#39;re running away from everything, then?\n\nChi~chan-senpai doesn&#39;t have anything to do with this, does he?\n\nYes, he does.\nMorisawa asked me to do this last night— he said he wanted you to watch this video.\n\n\nAkehoshi, are you watching?\nIt seems like you&#39;re trying to take on some pretty big hardships by yourself. That strength deserves respect.\nStill. I want you to pause for a moment and take a look around.\nThere should definitely be irreplaceable friends supporting you there.\n\nI think you&#39;re much stronger than I think...\nEven so, I&#39;m worried about you.\n\nI&#39;m always ready to collab, Akehoshi! Get in touch anytime!\n\n\n...\n\nIt seems he broke from RYUSEITAI to collaborate with all sorts of other idols, and according to him, it&#39;s because he wants to help you.\nHe said he wants to use his own influence to clear your name and dispel the accusations of power harassment.\nAkehoshi. You&#39;ve got a bit of an idea of it by now, right?\nYou&#39;re being irresponsible. Why won&#39;t you take up Morisawa&#39;s offer already?\nYou&#39;ll have no future if you don&#39;t clear away the online firestorm that&#39;s severly handicapping you. If you aren&#39;t chosen to be one of the &quot;Six Selected of Song&quot;, you&#39;ll just waste the whole month doing nothing, right?\n\nHasumin-senpai.\nSorry, I can&#39;t get on board with that.\n\nWhy? Akehoshi—\nAt this point, you can&#39;t possibly be this stubborn, are you?\n\nAhaha. It&#39;s that too, but—\nI want Chi~chan-senpai to keep up this pace, advance and win.\n\nEveryone is rooting for Chi~chan-senpai right now. It&#39;s a really rare opportunity to really shine, y&#39;know? I won&#39;t be able to take responsibility for that if I ruin it.\nBesides. you&#39;re finally starting to get back on track, right, Hasumin-senpai? I&#39;ll be fine, so just focus on yourself, y&#39;know?\n\n... I see.\nI don&#39;t intend to brush away your feelings and force you into letting me help. That would just be conceited.\n\nBut, I&#39;ll just impart upon you this.\nAsking for help isn&#39;t a bad thing. Even now, you might be able to win.\nYour goal is to stand on the Sphere stage, right? You&#39;re not going to be stubborn and ruin your chance to make a comeback, are you?\n\nYeah. Of course I get that.\nIt feels weird to say it, but... after getting in this situation, I finally noticed it.\n\nThere are people who will worry about me like this when I&#39;m feeling down.\nEveryone in Trickstar, and Chi~chan-senpai too, and tons of others who came to see me.\nAnd Hasumin-senpai too, huh.\n\nI feel like this is what can&#39;t be measured in &quot;Nice!&quot;s. So I still have the will to fight.\nI know it&#39;s pretty late to say this, but I&#39;m sorry for running away over and over.\n\nYou should say that to Morisawa, not me. He&#39;d definitely cry tears of joy.\n\nEh~? I&#39;m definitely not gonna say that! He&#39;s kinda a pain, so he&#39;ll get carried away with it!\nAnyways, it&#39;s Chi~chan-senpai, so he&#39;ll probably just watch the stream and say something anyways.\n\nHaha. Well, I can&#39;t say you don&#39;t have a point.\nIt&#39;s Morisawa. I imagine he&#39;s watching the stream from somewhere out there, worrying about you.\n\nThat&#39;s what we like to call a &quot;stalker&quot;, yeah? You get that right?\nIt&#39;s not just Chi~chan-senpai. To my other friends who care about me too!\nIf you&#39;re worried about me, I&#39;m sorry for troubling you!\n\nBut, you can rest easy, &#39;kay?\nThe flames online finally helped me see it. I&#39;d been so caught up on &quot;Nice!&quot;s, I couldn&#39;t see anything past it, but...\nIt&#39;s exactly because of all this that I feel I can definitely do something interesting...!\n\nEpilogue 1\n\n    Two days after Esu and Subaru Stream. SPHERE Stage.\n\n\n&quot;Everyone! How do you like the Sailing Ceremony prepared for the MEGASTREAM?&quot;\n&quot;Up until now, various idols have been hosting talk segments and variety streams, prayed for the Mega Sphere to set sail, and come to give you all a warm reception.&quot;\n&quot;All morning, Sailing Ceremony has featured various events, and now it&#39;s time to for the main event: the Sphere Live: the Four Kings of the Heavens against the Six Selected of Song!&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve kept the rankings completely hidden from all of you watching since the afternoon two days ago. Now, it&#39;s time to reveal the members!&quot;\n&quot;The &quot;Six Selected of Song&quot;— are you all ready?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes! We&#39;re ready!&quot;\n\n&quot;Heheh. A very fine response indeed!&quot;\n&quot;Now, let&#39;s begin the introductions. The first chosen for the &quot;Six Selected of Song&quot; is the man you all expected!&quot;\n\n\n&quot;The man who defended9 his ranking right beneath the &quot;Four Kings of the Heavens&quot; all the way through, Morisawa Chiaki-kun!&quot;\n&quot;His independent support streams helped boost the MEGASTREAM&#39;s positivity, and he received a ton of &quot;Nice!&quot;s in return.&quot;\n&quot;It was a system where everyone could be happy, without kicking anyone down. With Morisawa-kun at the helm— someone who made such a wonderful stream— the Six Selected of Song have been chosen.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Nito Nazuna-kun, Hakaze Kaoru-kun.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Hasumi Keito-kun—&quot;\n\n\n&quot;... And lastly, Esu-kun and Akehoshi Subaru-kun!&quot;\n\n&quot;The aforementioned six have earned the right to challenge the Four Kings of the Heavens! Everyone, step forth!&quot;\n\n&quot;Heheh. I&#39;m happy to be fighting alongside you all.&quot;\n&quot;NiceP mostly highlighted my stream, but needless to say, everyone&#39;s hard work was what led to these great results.\n\n&quot;Why don&#39;t we all work together and take down the Four Kings of the Heavens!&quot;\n\n&quot;Right. Naturally, I&#39;ll do my best, being selected comes with responsibility.&quot;\n\n&quot;Still, I never thought something like my daily life could be the talk of the town. Who would&#39;ve posssibly known that there were &quot;Nice!&quot;s hiding in the daily life of a son of the temple.&quot;\n&quot;The guys in AKATSUKI were all convinced of it, but I still don&#39;t really get it...&quot;\n\n&quot;Ahaha. I feel the same way~ Honestly, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get selected at all, y&#39;know?&quot;\n&quot;Looks like my love advice was a nice idea, huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;That makes me happy. It means that the girls really connected with it and enjoyed it ♪&quot;\n\n&quot;Apart from Chiaki-chin, I feel like the winners were decided by whoever went viral.&quot;\n&quot;My &quot;Nii~chan Streams&quot; weirdly caught on with people?&quot;\n&quot;Mm~n, well, I guess this doesn&#39;t apply to everyone, but... there&#39;s a surprising amount of adults who want to be younger brothers and sisters. Modern people are steeped in stress, after all.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, luck is involved with real skill too.&quot;\n&quot;Honestly, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be selected to be a member either, but I feel like we ended up with a good balance of six, some way or another.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah. Some people were able to find a silver lining amid an online firestorm. I should take pride in being selected too, shouldn&#39;t I?&quot;\n\n&quot;What the? Are you gossiping about me?&quot;\n&quot;If you&#39;re gonna praise me, you should say it to my face~ We&#39;re all buddies in the same Six Selected by Song, right~?&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t get carried away. How incorrigible...&quot;\n\n&quot;The way you&#39;ve been behaving has made me nervous the whole time.&quot;\n&quot;And Morisawa was far more worried about it than me. You should really give that guy a few words of appreciation.&quot;\n\nEpilogue 2\n\n“♪~♪~♪”\n“♪~♪~♪”\n\n&quot;Sakuma&#39;s going all out, huh. He&#39;s not showing any mercy, even against someone from the same unit.&quot;\n&quot;Still, Hakaze&#39;s a man who has stood beside Sakuma and seen him up close. I don&#39;t imagine it&#39;s going to be easy, even for Sakuma.&quot;\n\n&quot;Gyahaha! Is now really the time to be worrying about someone else?&quot;\n&quot;I&#39;m your opponent, y&#39;know, Mr. Leader of AKATSUKI!&quot;\n\n&quot;So you&#39;re calling me by my title, not my name. Amagi.&quot;\n&quot;I haven’t forgotten how you&#39;ve incited a wave of slander towards AKATSUKI before, even now.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well then, guess you&#39;ve got a damn good opportunity to settle the score, don&#39;t you, Six Selected of Song! I&#39;ve gotten used to VIP treatment, so I&#39;ve been a lil&#39; bored, y&#39;know?&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmph. Watching you play the role of villain in the Four Kings of the Heavens is cute, but how about I teach you a little lesson.&quot;\n\n&quot;... Is what I&#39;d like to say, but I won’t fall for cheap provocations like that anymore.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;The only ones I face are the fans who saw something good in me. You&#39;re not even on my radar.&quot;\n&quot;Knock yourself out, keep dancing on your own. Me? I&#39;ll be going my own way...♪&quot;\n“♪~♪~♪”\n\nUuuu. Rinne-kun&#39;s gotten way to good at playing the villain role!\nOur beef with AKATSUKI ended forever ago, so why is he digging it back up again now!?\n\nThis is definitely the kind of professional wrestling Rinne-han delights in. Maybe he saw that someone successfully tempered down the flames of an online firestorm, and figured he could make use of it?\n\nYes. Amagi is not the kind of man that instigates hostility without a reason.\nI imagine he thought that it would please the viewers. I find it a little precarious, but— it was saved by the fact his opponent didn&#39;t bother with it.\n\nHonestly... Rinne-han stirs things up whenever he gets the chance.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ コスパ (cospa; cost-effective) and タイパ (taipa; time-effective) are business principles; as you might guess, it's about being effective with your cost and your time.↑ 真実の和風 or true Japanese-style.

Today will become a day to remember for RYUSEITAI…☆\n\nNo, umm, Taichou-dono… Wasn’t I a little too assertive by asking that…?\nNinjas are my own personal interest, after all.\nI feel a little sorry to make everyone in RYUSEITAI go along with it.\n\nyou’re so reserved, shinobu ~ It’s one for all~♪\n\nAnd all for one! That’s RYUSEITAI! Fwahahaha!☆\nIf anything, everyone usually goes along with my principles, so...\nI’ve been wanting to prioritize what everyone else wants to do every once in a while.\n\nit’s not as if we’re being forced to [go along with you], chiaki~ because for me, i am doing what [i want to do].\n\nAhaha. When you say it like that, it saves me some face, but…\nTakamine, Nagumo — Follow Sengoku’s example. If there’s something you want to do, say it without any hesitation! I will always welcome it! ♪\n\nSomething I want to do… Okay then, can I go home already…? ♪\n\nI knew you’d say that! I just knew you’d say that!\nMidori-kun, weren’t you complainin’ that you’re bored ‘cause there’s no RYUSEITAI activities?\nIf you’re gonna sit at home with too much time on your hands, then you might as well face some difficulties!\n\nSpeaking of which, I wanna do something like Taishou did the other day in the Quarrel Festival!\nIt was so manly and sparks were flyin’ everywhere from the clash! I was so jealous~♪\n\nYeah. We weren’t really able to participate in the Quarrel Festival beyond livening up the crowd… It might be a good idea to do it properly.\nI’ll take note of that opinion.\n\n[quarrel festival] was violent. i [didn’t like] it…~ fighting is [no good]. can’t we get along instead?\n\nHeh. Sometimes exchanging fists is also part of friendship, Buchou-dono. A true blade is forged by striking it over and over again until sparks fly…♪\n\nspeaking as if you understand… well, [what happens next] matters more than [what has already happened]~\nshinobu, what sort of [dreamfes] do you want to [participate] in?\n\nErrr, well… Anzu-dono has prepared copies of the proposal and announcement posters for everyone, so I’ll hand them out ♪\n\nI’ll help you, Sengoku-kun~ Anzu-Anego, thank you for your hard work ♪\n\nHmm… Is this request coming from outside the school? An unveiling ceremony for a new attraction at a tourist spot…\n“If possible, we would like multiple popular units to appear.”\n\nSo since it’s a unit-based job, Sengoku couldn’t do it on his own, and he came to consult me...\nAchieving this goal with this budget seems like a challenge, though.\n\nAaah… so it really is impossible…? Anzu-dono was also really worried about what to do, given that it’s such an unreasonable request on her~\n\nHeh. Never fear, Sengoku– An ally of justice makes the impossible possible!\n\nUm, AKATSUKI’s… Kanzaki-kun, right? Could I have a moment with you?\n\nMm? Me? That’s fine, say whatever you want.\n\nYes. Would it be possible to wedge AKATSUKI into this project?\nIf Hasumi were to have a hand in this, I know he could make even an impossible plan come to fruition.\nIf the student council were to authorize it as an official DreamFes, we’d be able to get additional funding. That’s a feasible way we could make it happen.\nYour presence here is somewhat like fate. I’d be glad if we could have your cooperation.\n\nI see… I too want to make Sengoku’s dream come true. I’ll try and put in a good word for him.\nHasumi-dono is a little busy right now, so I don’t want to burden him too much.\nBut Hasumi-dono is a person deeply filled with compassion and virtue. Even if he can’t fully get involved, I&#39;m confident he will offer some insight.\nI will rush to the student council room to speak with him at once–!\n\nWait. We might as well go together since Hasumi and I get along too. Anzu, please come with us as well. You’re in charge of this project, aren’t you?\nAnd Sengoku, you too. You’re the one with the most enthusiasm for this project. If you’re with us, it’ll be easier to persuade Hasumi.\n\nIndeed. After all, Hasumi-dono is an empathetic soul! I see you understand him very well ♪\n\nWe’re classmates, after all. As for everyone else, I know it was a lot of trouble to come in and I’m sorry for that, but… it&#39;s okay to call it a day and disband for now.\nI’ll keep you updated if there’s any progress.\n\nNo way, I’m coming with you too! It might be a nuisance if too many people crowd the room, but since I’ve got no club activities today, I have some free time.\n– …C’mon, Midori-kun, don’t just go home, ‘kay~?\n\nEhh…? Didn’t he just say “disband”…?\n\nnow now…let’s all go [together], midori…~\nthe five of us together make [ryuseitai]. as long as everyone is there, any [miracle] can be performed ♪\n\nChapter 2\n\n    Location: Student Council Room\n\n\nHm… I see. I get the gist of it.\n\nEh? You could understand the situation with such little explanation? As expected of Hasumi-dono~♪\n\nDon’t be too liberal with flattery, Kanzaki. It’ll make you look cheap.\nAt any rate, day after day…\nLike Prince Shotoku3, I work on multiple proposals at the same time, making adjustments while listening to a variety of opinions.\nThis much I can do with ease.\nMorisawa had a clear grasp of the proposal’s outline and its main purpose. Even a monkey would understand it if it heard from this guy and filled in the gaps on its own.\n\nFwahaha! I don’t really follow, but I can tell you’re praising me! Thank you, Hasumi…☆\n\nI’m not praising you. It’s just a simple fact. Nevertheless, don’t make too much noise in the student council room.\nIt’s partly my fault, but these days the student council seems to be looked down upon.\nJust thinking of people perceiving us as a group of idiots makes me angry, so we have to buckle down. We have to maintain order in a disciplined, serious fashion.\nWe’ll just lose face if we take initiative and make a ridiculous scene.\n\nThe way you word things is a little tricky, Hasumi… To put it simply, what do you mean by that?\nThis project is about ninjas rampaging through a castle.\nIt could turn up looking something like foolish horseplay. Given AKATSUKI’s focus on strict, traditional performance, do you think it’ll even be possible for the concept to fit in with AKATSUKI’s image?\n\nIf possible, I’d like to do something like a joint live performance between RYUSEITAI and AKATSUKI, but...\nI can&#39;t force you. If you guys say no, then that&#39;s that.\n\nDid you forget that the other day, we were the protagonists of the raucous commotion of historic proportion called the Quarrel Festival?\nTradition is not just about adhering to the formal and strict relics of ancient times.\nUkiyo-e, now highly regarded around the world, was originally considered to have as much artistic value as tissue paper.\nIt became an art from the changes of the period and the efforts of our predecessors.\n\nIn a former age, TV, games, and even idols were ridiculed and looked down upon as tacky.\nBut now their statuses have risen, and they’ve all become major industries.\nNow, in our modern day, even the things that are looked down upon as vulgar or commonplace... With time and effort, they become art.\nFor future generations, it may even be appreciated as part of traditional culture.\n\nNinjas… Aren’t they splendid? Since it has an air of Japanese style, we can incorporate it within the context of AKATSUKI.\nIt will strengthen the approachability that we lack.\nOf course, it won’t be easy… but if done well, I think it would be a mutually beneficial proposal.\n\nI’ll formalize some official paperwork, approve it as a DreamFes, and formulate a budget.\nI’ll have to adjust my schedule as well… and contact Kiryu…\n\nHe gets into some surprisingly bad behavior when he has free time on his hands.\n\nU-Um—!\n\nHm? What’s the matter… Sengoku, is it? Is there something you want to say?\n\nNo, um… So, you like ninjas? That’s unexpected~♪\n\nThere is no boy out there who doesn&#39;t like ninjas or dinosaurs.\nI heard that you&#39;re hosting a Ninja Association of some kind. You are the lord of one country and one castle. Since you manage it without the help of anyone else, be more resolute.\nIsara’s been worried, so even though club activities are just a hobby, you should give it all your might.\n\nAh, yes! This time at least, I’ll do my best to move everything forward~♪\n\nYes, keep at it. The same goes for this project — If we say it was done with the full cooperation of the Ninja Association, it’ll be a part of its records.\nSince I’ll be drafting documents along those lines already, I’d like you to prepare necessary materials.\nWe’re already halfway into this school term, so I suppose you can’t expect any new members, but...\nYou&#39;re a first-year student. If you create a track record now, you’ll have that next year and circumstances will change.\n\nIt&#39;s an investment into the future. Depending on the results, it could serve as a good promotion for your club activities. So, well, make sure to work hard.\n\nI understand! Uwaaa, I&#39;m so happy! You&#39;re thinking about me properly~♪\n\nHmph... Since this is your own project, lead it, and consult with Morisawa throughout.\nKanzaki, as AKATSUKI’s representative, you will cooperate with RYUSEITAI and ensure things go smoothly.\nAs you know, I&#39;m fairly busy. As we speak, my overall progress is slowing down.\nI want to leave things to you when I can.\nI&#39;ll practice properly and make sure it&#39;s perfect by the time of the actual performance, but I don&#39;t want any extra work in the meantime.\n\nKanzaki… You can’t rely upon me and Kiryu forever.\nSometimes it&#39;s good to be the man in front. This time, the fate of AKATSUKI is entrusted to you.\n\nDon&#39;t get too reckless, or it’ll just cause trouble for everyone. Try your absolute best, you can do it.\n\nM– Mm! I will do my best!\nOh, my blood is searing! Cheer for me, Sengoku! I have been entrusted with a role I’ve never had before!\nPlease tell me anything, I will fully cooperate as the leader of AKATSUKI! ♪\n\nYeah! If it’s Kanzaki-dono, it’ll be like I have the power of a hundred people helping me~♪\n\nYou two are good friends, huh... Well, that&#39;s all for now. Start moving quickly. Before you know it, time will pass and it’ll be the day of the actual performance.\nI&#39;ll take care of my work as soon as possible and join you when it’s done.\n\nMm! It&#39;s time to conquer, and the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step! Kanzaki Souma, pushing onward...☆\n\n(Heheh. He&#39;s so excited, that Kanzaki).\n(Up to this point, Kiryu and I have done everything in AKATSUKI. It’s not his fault, but… unfortunately, in all that time, that guy never really had to bear the brunt of anything).\n(We won&#39;t be here next year, so Kanzaki must study hard so that he can stand on his own when the time comes).\n\n(Ah, I can&#39;t help but tear up... I wonder if this is what it&#39;s like when your children become independent).\n(I feel lonely, but I&#39;m proud. Do your best, Kanzaki, I&#39;ll always be on your side).\n\nChapter 3\n\n    Location: Garden Terrace\n\n\nAlright. For the most part, it’s coming together.\nThe name of the DreamFes is “Scroll of the Elements”, and it’ll be a joint live performance between RYUSEITAI and AKATSUKI.\nThe theme is “ninjas”. It seems they want to do a tie-in with a movie if possible.\n\nDue to copyright issues, we can’t really use movie lines verbatim, but...\nWell, design-wise, we should keep to the theme as best we can.\nThe performance doesn’t need to be a musical-esque narrative either.\nRegardless, I&#39;m sure fans of the movie will come to see it, so I&#39;d like to take the initiative to incorporate its trademark lines.\n\nThe DreamFes venue is a tourist spot that recreates the world of period dramas. It gets used for movie shootings, too.\nAdditionally, the sponsor will be the event organizers at the site.\nThe organizers have the personnel and know-how to manage stage production, so we can just give our input and leave it to them. Hasumi and I will handle the negotiations.\n\nThe purpose of the live show is to attract tourists to the venue and promote newly opened attractions and facilities.\nAdmission will be free. It seems that the profit will come from limited-edition merchandise.\nI’ll leave the preparation of goods and the like to Anzu. It’s her specialty, and she seems to have connections.\n\nI’ll also ask Anzu to handle discussions about the goods. If you have any trouble, Anzu, Hasumi and I are willing to help you.\nI want you all to tell her your opinions about the kinds of merchandise that would work.\n\nWhen it comes to merchandise, how about yuru-characters…?4 ♪\nAnzu-san, what kind of mascot characters does the tourist spot have…? Every tourist spot has one these days…\n\nAh… A cute ninja called “Hanzoumon”...? As in, Hanzou-mon?\nIt’s like a vague combination of the names of the famous ninja Hattori Hanzou5 and the famous yuru-chara Kumamon, huh…? ♪\n\nAh, Takamine, sorry. Your captain is talking right now, so please be quiet.\n\nEhh...? Even though you never listen whenever I tell you to shut up...?\n\nAhaha... Anyway, most guests at tourist destinations aren’t usually interested in idols.\nOf course, our fans will come to see us, but for the most part, the audience will be the general public.\nThere will be a lot of older people who don&#39;t know about the unspoken etiquette of idol concerts, so...\nWe’ll have to be careful about how we present ourselves. Be mindful of your words and actions and be considerate. Give thorough explanations.\n\nIf things go well, we&#39;ll be able to attract new fans out of the people who don&#39;t normally have anything to do with us. Good luck, everyone. Hip, hip, hooray! ♪\n\nHip, hip, hooray! ♪ I&#39;ll check with Hasumi-dono, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any problem with AKATSUKI going in that direction.\nNow that the outline has been decided, I would like to work out the specific content of the “raibu”6.\n\nSounds good. Sengoku is the one who knows a lot about ninjas, so I&#39;ll leave it to him from here on out.\nAh~... I&#39;m a little worn out after such a lively discussion. I&#39;m parched.\n\nI&#39;ve made some tea, so please help yourself. There are also teacakes I’ve made by hand.\n\nsouma, you’re getting [better and better] at cooking, aren’t you…~?\n\nCooking aside, I’ve practiced conducting tea ceremonies since I was a child. It&#39;s a samurai tradition...\nThough, I don’t feel that it matches the Western-style atmosphere of “Gaaden Terasu”.\n\nChapter 4\n\nAnyway, everyone, help yourselves to some refreshments.\n\nWow! Thank you so much~ I used my brain a lot today, so it’s craving sugar~♪\n\nI am the same way. I should try to think for myself without leaving things to my seniors more often… However, they say that it&#39;s difficult to tell a poor thinker from a sleeping one.\n\nahaha. as a [senior], i would like you to try [thinking] for yourself a little more.\n[leaving everything up to us] entirely is a lot of [responsibility], which is [frightening].\n\nYeah. I think so too.\nBut Kanzaki-kun is a second year student. He has solid opinions, a lot of experience, and he’s reliable. His input was pretty helpful.\nThanks to him, Scroll of the Elements is coming together surprisingly smoothly.\n\nHaha, I feel somewhat bashful. Kiryu-dono is delayed in joining us, and Hasumi-dono can&#39;t take his hands off student council duties, so...\nAs the representative of AKATSUKI, I shouldn’t do anything embarrassing.\n\nhow admirable, souma. good boy, good boy…♪7\n\nHuh? Buchou-dono is extremely kind today…! But he always treats me rather harshly, so it&#39;s actually kind of scary…?\nNo, but I understand that the usual is a matter of tough love!\n\nufufu. if you always acted [seriously], i wouldn’t be so [unkind] to you, either…~♪\n\nUuu... I always try to be serious, though…\n\nThat’s not fair~! Shinkai-dono, you’re being really nice to your club’s underclassman, huh~?\ni am always [kind]~. [clubs] and [units] are different.\nif i had the same [attitude] for both, it’d be [weird], wouldn’t it?\n\nNghhh, I want Taishou8 to pat my head and call me a good kid, too. Um, Kanzaki-senpai, Taishou seems like he’s busy… I wonder where he is right now; what’s he been doing…?\n\nHaven&#39;t you heard? Lately, Kiryu-dono’s been participating in a multitude of “B1”&#39; tournaments out of the blue.\nYou see, one of his classmates has asked him to appear to help.9\nThough this is our decompression period, he said that if he has nothing to do, he will inevitably get out of shape…\nAfter all, that man is a warrior at heart.\nAdditionally, we, AKATSUKI, have always ruled as statesmen, and have only ever competed against weak opponents.\nTherefore, it’s likely he wanted to dress up as a footsoldier and crawl through the mud to gauge the atmosphere of the front lines.\nOtherwise, our perceptions will gradually deviate from reality.\n\nIf you settle for turning away from battle and hiding in basecamp, you will lose your survival instinct and miscalculate the real state of affairs.\nThat sort of thing is what he seems to think, anyway. I agree with Kiryu-dono, and I’m proud of him. The two of us are lucky to have a great senior♪\n\nU~myu… If that&#39;s how it is, I wish he’d invited me too. Is it unmanly to think that way?\n\nBut Taishou’s way of life really is cool after all~♪\nIt’s been a while since Taishou’s gone around operating solo... Ahh, I’d love to see that valiant figure. Can I go watch his match for a li’l while?\n\nAfter we finish having this discussion. You and Sengoku are both first years, so support him.\nFor having peers you can walk alongside with is something to be very thankful for.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Souma refers to Kanata as 部長 (buchou, lit. chief ), or club president (Kanata's position in their club).↑ Kanata's dialogue is completely in hiragana, likely to emphasize his slow, relaxed way of speaking.

It’s just that when I saw you, Kanzaki-dono, I got so happy that I ran up to you~\n\nWhat, are you a puppy? However, I&#39;m happy that you’ve become attached to me, as I don’t have much of a relationship with the underclassmen.\n\nKanzaki-dono, it’s hard to approach you because you always walk around with a sword hanging at your side. You’re also a member of AKATSUKI, the student council’s headlining unit…\nIt’s absolutely because of things like that that everyone perceives you as an intimidating person.\n\nAre you also scared of me, Sengoku…?\n\nNot at all! I used to think you were a menacing person, but when I talked to you, I realized you were really kind!3\n\nAh, but is it going to be too annoying if I get too friendly?!\n\nThat won’t happen. Let’s continue to get along… Sengoku ♪\nAt any rate, Sengoku, are you free right now? Hasumi-dono asked me to put up these “posutaa” on the bulletin board.\nHowever, I’m having a difficult time with the amount. I’d appreciate your help.\n\nThat’s an easy task~! RYUSEITAI has just finished a big job4 and is currently on a break, so I have plenty of free time!\nSurprisingly, our unit’s Taichou-dono5 gives us plenty of good rest~♪\n\nIt is the same for me. We are both blessed with good masters, aren’t we?\nAKATSUKI is also on break.\n\nThe “Harouin Paatii” S1 will be held soon, you see.

It makes me feel shameful. Could it be because I lack independence?\n\nAh, I also have a lot of free time when RYUSEITAI isn’t active. We’re similar after all~♪\n\nIs that right? Well, ninjas and warriors might be similar in the eyes of the public, I suppose, but....\n\n…Hm? Forgive me, Anzu-dono. I was about to kick you. Why are you kneeling here?\nAre you feeling unwell?

Even Hasumi-dono is overlooking it at this point.\n\nActually, the other day, we AKATSUKI participated in the “B1” Quarrel Festival...\nWe’re not in a position where we can openly regulate “B1”s anymore.\nIf we were to criticize someone for participating, and they were to criticize us for having done the same, we wouldn’t be able to refute it.\nBut a lively atmosphere is a good thing, so I suppose it&#39;s a mixed blessing.\n\n…Huh?

But, well, it seems like it was a nice break for you.\n\nI won’t do anything reckless, so don’t worry. I’m not gonna cause any trouble for AKATSUKI or the student council.\nI’m in a position of authority now, so I can’t be a naughty kid.\n\nI know. No, I trust you. I’m sorry for putting you in such an inconvenient position, Kiryu.\n\nI’m not a brat, y’know, I agreed to it. I don’t think of myself as inconvenienced or tied down.\nAdult freedom is freedom as long as it doesn’t hurt the public.\nInstead of getting wasted and going on a tear at a coming-of-age ceremony... Having a glass of beer after a long bath at the end of a hard day&#39;s work is probably more precious.\n\n… You don&#39;t drink alcohol, do you?\n\nI’m drunk almost every day, even without the use of alcohol, y’know. ...Oh, it looks like that Kanzaki guy finally arrived after waiting forever, huh?\n\nEh, where? Mm… my eyesight might have gotten worse again.\n\n\nHasumi-donooooo! Kiryu-donooooo! I apologize for arriving late…!\nKanzaki Souma has arrived, please forgive my rudeness! To atone for being late, I will disembowel myself on the cross!2\n\nA HOOORSE?!\nK-... K-K… Kanzaki?! You— a-aah— even I can’t find the words for this—!\n\nWhat’s wrong, Hasumi-dono! Calm down, please; we are at one’s palace!\nAre you nervous before the big stage? So Hasumi-dono also has a novice side to him~♪\n\nO-Oi, Kanzaki? Stop for a sec, don’t just rush in without pause?!\n\nAh—! Once more, please forgive me!\nThis horse and I were in such harmony3, I had forgotten that I was still riding! Ha-ha-ha☆\n\nKanzaki… For now, dismount that horse, and sit seiza4 there.\n\nHuh? Hmm... I guess you&#39;re angry at me for being late, Hasumi-dono.\nYour anger is understandable. I will slit open my stomach promptly, then. I will leave the beheading to you~♪5\n\nDon&#39;t commit seppuku so easily. I’ve always wondered this about you, but from what era did you time-travel from?\n\nWell, you see, hahaha... The hands on my family’s clock have stopped since the Edo period.\n\nHave your parents been pestering you  or something? It seems your relatives aren&#39;t very fond of idol activities...\nAnd so, they didn’t pay for transportation, giving you no choice but to take a horse?\n\nAh, no. After a long period of convincing, my father and mother are finally showing some understanding.\nHasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono, and Anzu-dono have all visited my home many times and spoke for me to them, after all.\nThey can feel your sincerity. Besides, my parents aren&#39;t that antiquated6. Some relatives still wear bitterness on their faces, though.\nI was the one who knocked on the door of Yumenosaki Academy with the desire to become an “aidoru”.\nNo matter what anyone says, and no matter what hardships I may be given, my feelings will not change.\nBut if it&#39;s a nuisance for AKATSUKI and everyone else... I have no choice but to apologize.\n\nWhen have I ever said you’re a nuisance? Well, it is a bit of a bother, but... If you’re a proper man, follow through on your original intention.\nIf you desire the world, then grasp it for yourself. Kiryu and I will always be on your side.\n\nAhaha, I don&#39;t want something so ambitious, but...\nAs a samurai warrior who attends Hasumi-dono and Kiryu-dono, I’m committed to not being a disgrace at the very least.\nBy the way, this horse is owned by our family. His name is Saigodon.\nAs far as I’m concerned, we’re like brothers who grew up running around the mountains and fields together.\nApparently they&#39;re going to use him for movie filming, so... my parents told me that if we were going to the same destination, I could ride him here.\nAnd since I thought it would be faster than walking, I mounted him.\nHowever, in the end, I wound up getting stuck in traffic and almost being late. Modern Japan is not very suitable for traveling by horse.\n\nI&#39;ve always been telling you to choose a more modern mode of transportation.\nWell, even if it can&#39;t be helped this time, from now on, you&#39;ll meet up with me or Kiryu first and then head to the site.\n\nMm, understood~♪\n\nYou’re only ever good at responses, aren&#39;t you...?\n\nChapter 2\n\nLook, Saigodon. It’s my seniors, say hello~♪\n\nEeep, don&#39;t lick me! Can&#39;t you see, I&#39;m already dressed and have my makeup done!\nYou too, er… Saigodon? After you’ve safely delivered him, go get changed!\n\nHmm. There&#39;s no need to be so scared, Hasumi-dono.\nSaigodon is an excellent horse trained in acting. He can purposefully fall down in ways that don’t hurt his rider.\n\nI’m not really scared, but big creatures have a sense of intimidation that threatens our survival instincts.\nI do also have trauma. When I was young, and I misbehaved, I would get locked in a room lined with giant Buddha statues.\n\nWell, that’s odd. Aren’t you on good terms with the huge Kiryu-dono?\n\nI can talk, can’t I? Danna’s eloquent, but he’ll have trouble speaking with things that don’t speak back.\nThere, there, there... He’s bein’ real obedient, huh? What a very clever horse~♪\n\nUm, everyone~? It’s gotten noisy for some reason, but has Kanzaki-dono arrived?\nIf that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d like to do a rehearsal of the performance shortly~?\n— Is that a horse?! Wow, it really feels like I’ve traveled back in time to the Sengoku period~♪7\n\nHm, a scoundrel! I jest… Sengoku’s completely a ninja now~♪8\n\nI&#39;ve been a ninja from the beginning, haven&#39;t I~? Hehe, this is a real ninja costume made by a professional who works on period dramas!\nWell, it&#39;s a stage costume, so it&#39;s also flashy and colorful~♪\n\nAre you not concerned about historical research or authenticity, Sengoku?\n\nWell, if you wanted to be authentic, ninjas rarely wore “ninja outfits” to begin with.\nSince they were intelligence operatives, it was normal for ninjas to blend in with the crowd by disguising themselves as townspeople or monks.\nIn order to adapt to modern times, there is a certain degree of symbolization... characterization that’s needed.\nI admired ninjas not because of the way they looked, but because of their way of life~♪\n\nIs that right? Sengoku is remarkable, he really has an eye for discerning the true nature of things...♪\n\n…~♪\n\nHuh? What is it, Hasumi-dono? Why are you looking at me so pleasantly?\n\nWell, Kanzaki acting like a senior is rare, so it&#39;s just interesting...\nAlright, stop the chatter and go change your clothes. We, AKATSUKI, cannot neglect our role of being the perfect example.\n\nKanzaki, I&#39;ll help you get dressed. I wanna do the finishing touches to your hair and makeup myself.\n\nMm, I’m grateful. Only with Kiryu-dono’s consideration are we complete as AKATSUKI.\nBut before that, I&#39;m going to deliver the Saigodon to the movie set, so please excuse me for a moment~♪\n\nKanzaki-dono~, I want to ride the horse, too~♪\nSengoku, sometimes you unexpectedly say things like a toddler. Alright, get on, get on.\nIt’ll be light enough if it’s only you. Don’t shout, or you’ll frighten Saigodon.\n\nUnderstood! Wow, I’ve always dreamed of riding a horse~♪\n\nOi, wait a minute. Sengoku, your stage clothes will get dirty…\n\nGallop, gallop ♪ Hi-ho, Saigodon!\n\nHaha, now it&#39;s not a period drama, but a Western one...♪\n\nAh, they’ve gone off, how incorrigible. Our juniors are a little too free-spirited.\n\nHaha. As long as it&#39;s the kind of freedom that doesn’t cause trouble to others, it&#39;s fine. Us seniors can save strictness for when it’s needed.\n\n……….\n\nWhoa, you startled me. Morisawa, what’s wrong? Your complexion doesn’t look good?\n\nKiryu… Hasumi… What do you think love is?\n\nHah? Don&#39;t touch the koi9 in that river, they cost millions of yen.\n\nHasumi’s dumbassery aside, Morisawa, why are you sayin’ things straight out of a shoujo manga. Get it together, this is outta character for you.\n\nSorry, Taishou. Taichou’s been actin’ strange for a while now.\nThere was some kinda weird misunderstanding when he saw Sengoku-kun and Anzu-anego hugging each other.\nAs they said themselves, it&#39;s the same as when you hug Midori-kun and stuff, Taichou.\nIt’s just skinship.10 It’s not love or anything, right?\n\nMmngh… I know, but it was so shocking, even I’m surprised by my reaction…\nRight, Anzu’s a girl… And we’re all healthy high school students…\nEven if it were a millionth of a chance, there’s still a possibility it could happen. I didn&#39;t take that into consideration, even though being an ally of justice means preparing for all kinds of situations.\nThis time it was a misunderstanding, but someday it might not be a joke. I have to start thinking about what to do if that were to happen…\nUgh, but I&#39;m not good at topics like this!\n\nryusei cho~p~♪\nRyusei Ki~ck…♪\n\nUgya!? Wh-What are you two doing all of a sudden!? I&#39;m against violence...!\n\nHey, you can’t slack off when you’re the one who always acts big and tells me to concentrate…\nAnd besides… you always try to solve everything yourself…\nBut nobody ever asked you to do that… How many times do I have to tell you not to carry the burden all by yourself...?\n\nthat&#39;s right~ [helping when nobody ever asked] may be the hero&#39;s [duty], but chiaki is no longer [alone], right?\ni’m here, and so is everyone else. the five of us together are [ryuseitai].\nplease don&#39;t be conceited and think you&#39;re [fighting] all by yourself~♪\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Kuro often refers to Keito as 旦那 (danna, lit. master ), or &quot;boss&quot;. He'll also use Hasumi-no-danna.↑ 道場破り (dojoyaburi, lit. dojo storming ). In martial arts, this is when someone visits rival martial arts schools and challenges its members to assert dominance over whose technique is better. If the dojo lost, its apprentices would abandon it for the winner's school. Read more here.↑ If you're new to AKATSUKI stories, Souma's running gag is regularly resorting to performing seppuku to make up for trouble. 切腹 (seppuku or harakiri, lit. belly-cutting ) was a form of ritualistic suicide samurai used for a variety of reasons. For Souma, that tends to be shame. Here, Souma got a little creative and threatened 十字割腹 (juuji kappuku).↑ 人馬一体 (jinba ittai, lit. person + horse + one body/unity ) is an idiom in four-character compound form.↑ 正座 (seiza, lit. proper sitting ) is a formal, traditional way of sitting, commonly used in martial arts, tea-ceremony, etc. It was developed among samurai in the Edo period. Its difficult to maintain for long periods of time, so Keito's using it as both a punishment, and a manner of getting Souma to sit still so he can lecture him. It's also a way for Souma to convey his respect. Read more here↑ 介錯 (kaishaku) is a secondary role to the act of seppuku. An appointed second person beheads the one who has committed seppuku to spare them from prolonged anguish. This is typically reserved for samurai who choose seppuku for the sake of honor, rather than shame.↑ Another four-character compound, 時代錯誤 (jidai sakugo, lit. age, era + error, mistake ), meaning anachronism, or a person/thing that seems to belong to a different time period↑ The Sengoku period (戦国時代) is the backdrop for Scroll of the Elements, Shinobu and Souma's characters as a whole: for starters, it's a homonym for Shinobu's last name 仙石 (sengoku).↑ A callback to their first meeting, in the Samurai and Ninjas idol story↑ Chiaki used the word 恋 (koi) for romantic love. Keito thought he said 鯉 (koi), the fish.↑ スキンシップ (wordplay on skin and kinship) is the general idea that people socially bond through physical skin-to-skin contact, especially family and loved ones. It also applies to spending time together naked, like at bathhouses, where more general groups of people like coworkers or classmates platonically bond."},{"title":"Warriors of Stormy Times","url":"/translation/scroll_of_the_elements/warriors_of_stormy_times/","content":"\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n    Location: Scroll of the Elements Stage\n\n\nRight, gentlemen. Are you all ready? Well then, let&#39;s go~♪\nAn unprecedented gamble, where anything can happen— AKATSUKI and RYUSEITAI, a collaboration seen only in dreams! The curtain rises, and Scroll of the Elements is about to begin...!\n\n“It&#39;s the Age of Warring States, the era of rival factions… A small, peaceful and quiet country lies nestled in the cool shade of a mountain pass. Here, seeing the world is beyond one’s wildest dreams. Here, a strange incident has occurred.”\n“An impregnable mountain castle, protected by natural fortresses. Every day, the security guards sit cross-legged on its sturdy ground, careless with their duties. Taking advantage of those negligent security guards…”\n“A suspicious shadow is trying to sneak in.”\n\n(Ohh... As expected of Sengoku, you’re living up to the name of a Broadcasting Committee member. You speak quite fluently, with confidence.)\n(Your tone is easy and clear to the ears… What a pleasant voice to listen to.)\n\n(Heheh, I practiced a lot for this~♪)\n(Excuse me, Kanzaki-dono... my turn is coming, so I&#39;ll hand over the narration to you.)\n(Please make our first appearance as exciting as possible~♪)\n\n(Understood. I am also used to this kind of role.)\n“Come now, the main characters have made their entrance! Take a close look at today’s brave heroes!”\n\n“One~! I want to be the one to stand out from the crowd!”\n\nTwo…~ To tell you the truth, I just wanna hide…”\n\n“Three! We’re already going three different directions, huh~?”\n\n“Four! I don’t really follow, but not a problem, for we are close friends~♪”\n\n“Five! The five of us together are RYUSEITAI…☆”\n\n“Oh, what could that be? Is it a bird? Is it an airplane? No, it’s a ninja!”\n(Hmmm… It&#39;s the Sengoku period, so is it really alright to say something like &quot;airplane&quot;?)\n(Although, there are also period dramas where they do peace signs, so…?)\n(As long as the message gets across, then it’s fine. Noh and Kabuki use archaic words, so they aren’t able to convey even half of the fun for people without prior knowledge.)\n(The traditional performing arts may be like that, but…)\n(We are “aidoru”. AKATSUKI is a modern translation of a traditional art buried under the rubble of ancient times…)\n(Conveying that charm, making it shine as my weapon… That&#39;s how I intend to spend this fleeting life.)\n(Without throwing out the antiques, we will give them flesh and blood, inherit them, channel them! It&#39;s the same for sumo, kendo, traditional Japanese dance, tea ceremonies, and that of course means ninjas, as well!)\n(Inheriting the culture from all kinds of traditional arts…!)\n(We will become a bridge between the past and the future...!)\n\n“Landing, hup~♪”\n(Hehe. I&#39;ve grown used to stunts like this: like descending from a high place using rope work.)\n(In terms of setting, it is as if I’m flying in the sky with a kite and landing on the castle tower~♪)\n(Our mission is to invade the fortress and obtain the scroll that the lord of the castle is hiding in the tower.)\n(It’s said that hidden there is evidence of the lord’s infidelity.)\n(We ninjas were deployed at the request of the lord&#39;s wife.)\n(A cheating investigation~? It’s spy-like, so that means it’s also ninja-like. Plus, it makes it easier to understand for modern people, as well.)\n(After all, if they made the plot too serious, people would be turned off.)\n(The aim is to draw people in first with a bright and fun slapstick drama and then have them watch until the end.)\n(Scroll of the Elements can be viewed for free, so if you leave in the middle, your pockets won&#39;t be hurt...)\n(However, it would be a bit of a shame if people went home.)\n(The introduction, development, plot twist and conclusion. Slow, into an accelerando, and then the finale. Savor every bit of it! I would be happy if you could fall in love with ninjas, even just a little~♪)\n(I was accepted, and my “love” was affirmed!)\n(Even if it’s only by the kind members of Yumenosaki Academy’s RYUSEITAI so far!)\n(One day, I will spread it to the whole world! Ninjas are a single miracle that shined in me —  someone who had spent a gloomy youth all the way until high school started!)\n(“This is how it is as a ninja, for ninjas love solitude, love the dark, love frogs”...)\n(That was my excuse to get by at first, yet I was saved regardless.)\n(That is why I hope that someone who is living gloomy days like I once was will find the same salvation as I have!)\n(That is my wish, my dream! I will deliver it with all my heart and soul!)\n(After all, I love ninjas...☆ Until everyone shares that &quot;love&quot; with me, I can’t keep hiding in darkness!)\n(Wearing colorful and flashy costumes, we will continue to sing and dance on stage~!)\n\nChapter 2\n\n“♪～♪～♪”\n\n(Ohh… Sengoku, you&#39;ve completely let go. You&#39;re always reserved, or rather, you tend to retreat behind everyone else…)\n(Yet your eyes are sparkling right now. You really like ninjas, don&#39;t you? It&#39;s wonderful to have something you like.)\n(If you have that “love”, then your life — this whole world will be even brighter.)\n(That brilliance may make someone&#39;s dreams come true, like a shooting star.)\n(It could become a ray of hope for someone walking down an alley at night with their head down…  It could even become a miracle of its own.)\n(No. Let&#39;s form the trajectory for that miracle together.)\n“♪～♪～♪”\n\n(Senpai… Uh, I know you’re getting emotional right now, but aren’t you forgetting what you have to do…?)\n\n(Ohh, sorry. It&#39;s a bad habit of mine. When I&#39;m happy, I get so excited that my mind goes blank. Thank you for warning me, Takamine~♪)\n\n(I didn’t say anything particularly special… I usually blank out on stage, too, and I end up standing like a deer in headlights...)\n(At times like that, everyone is always there to back me up, right...?)\n(Even if it&#39;s just that much, I&#39;ll repay the favor... I have to clear up those debts properly, or else I&#39;ll feel uneasy...)\n\n(Yeah, you&#39;re a good kid, Takamine~♪ That&#39;s wonderful, the good you do for others is good you do yourself...! All for one, and one for all!)\n\n(Midori-kun, stand back for a sec. Taichou&#39;s gonna do some crazy stunt to blow a hole in the tower and break in.)\n(It uses gunpowder, so if you&#39;re too close, you&#39;ll get hit too.)\n\n(Mm, I know… Then the castle will catch fire, and we panic… Shinkai-senpai tries to extinguish the fire and creates a muddy stream...)\n(And then we all get swept away by it, right…)\n(The lyrics, production, and movements were all set so that the audience could understand what’s happening without needing an explanation...)\n(It&#39;s pretty amazing, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s slapstick and funny...♪)\n(If I could have, I would have loved to experience it as an audience member...♪)\n\n(Ahaha, it&#39;s the customer&#39;s privilege to have fun. But there&#39;s no rule that says we can&#39;t have fun, right?)\n(Guuhhh–! Every single time… The stage gets me psyched! I’m fired up~! ♪)\n“♪～♪～♪”\n\n“♪～♪～♪”\n\n(Mhm. Sengoku is obviously more lively this time, but Nagumo and Takamine have grown significantly since the first time we’ve met, too.)\n(For Nagumo, he lost his bad habit of rushing ahead.)\n(And for Takamine, he is able to take in his surroundings well enough to give me a heads up. This is a great sign, it&#39;s absolutely wonderful.)\n(It would be pathetic if I dragged everyone down here, so I&#39;ll show you how cool I am as your captain.)\n\n\n“We have no other choice— let&#39;s blast it open! Ninpou: Blazing Escape Technique...☆”\n(While making comical movements of panic to indicate that “Oh no! It’s causing a fire!”… The song and melody continues— is that right…?)\n(I was given some acting guidance, so I wonder if I’m managing to perform everything naturally…?)\n(It’s a pretty busy performance, with so much to do. But, well, period dramas are the distant ancestors of tokusatsu...)\n(For the land that gave birth to the heroes I love, I hope I can help cultivate the soil again.)\n(Times change and people change, but the voices of people who love justice and desire peace should be respected! Let&#39;s fight for that together, everyone~♪)\n“♪～♪～♪”\n\n“♪～♪～♪”\n(wawa—... i can’t handle the heat... it&#39;s real [gunpowder], that’s for sure. it&#39;s dangerous.)\n(i’ll become [grilled fish]~, i have to hurry and [extinguish] it.)\n\n\n \"ninpou: water escape technique～♪” \n\n(ohh… the [water] is flowing in, my skin feels [moisturized]~♪)\n(most of the [water] is for [show], but [fire extinguishing] foam is being [sprayed] everywhere at the same time...)\n(and in the blink of an eye, the [fire] goes out.)\n(i wonder what kind of [mechanism] they’re using… they did explain it, but it was [beyond my comprehension].)\n(this is the [art] of [special effects], huh~ it&#39;s like [magic].)\n([we] couldn&#39;t use [magic]. even though we were called something akin to [supernatural creatures]...)\n(we had no [means] to resist the bitter [reality].)\n(but, i am still alive. in this reality… i have found a [means] to survive — a [place to belong].)\n(feeling happy for being accepted… it’s not just you, shinobu.)\n(i was ostracized, and then driven [far away] from the [stars] in the night sky.)\n(but, there was someone who went so far as to stretch his hand out to me.)\n(i don’t [regret] grasping that [hand] tightly. sometimes it is so hot that it can be [uncomfortable], but….)\n(i was in the cold, icy [sea] so… fortunately, it feels warm.)\n(it fits just right, i’m [comfortable] like this.)\n(puka, puka…♪)\n\nChapter 3\n\n“♪～♪～♪”\n(Alright. So far so good. Let’s start putting the finishing touches on it.)\n(The samurai working in the castle who rush to engage the idiotic ninjas — That&#39;s our role as AKATSUKI.)\n(The lord of the castle is taking excessive defensive measures to prevent the scroll – evidence of an affair – from being stolen.)\n(Numerous traps and devices toss the RYUSEITAI ninjas about.)\n(We also get caught up in the commotion and end up falling into a trap together, going every which way.)\n“You’ll pay for this, you morons! I&#39;ll catch you and behead you~!”\n(Laughter everywhere... In the meantime, a strange friendship begins to develop between the ninja and the samurai, and there are more scenes of them escaping from pitfalls together.)\n(Rather than a true period drama, it should be seen as a skit based on that theme.)\n(I&#39;m sure Eichi and Hibiki would be in hysterics if they saw it. I&#39;m glad this was a joint live with RYUSEITAI instead of fine.)\n(Kyogen, monkey mawashi... Manzai, mandan, and rakugo are all traditional arts. Just because it&#39;s a comedy sketch doesn’t mean we’ll cut corners. We&#39;ll do our best to accomplish it.)\n(If everything goes well, people’s impression of AKATSUKI will change drastically.)\n(Since it&#39;s not a play, everything is expressed through song and dance... At minimum, it’s  supplemented with narration and such.)\n(The script was written by a professional, and the audience is able to understand it without any confusion.)\n(Our actions leave them on the edge of their seats, they sympathize, and they support us at times.)\n(It’s a pleasant feeling... Live performances aren&#39;t a gamble where people win or lose. I feel like I’ve remembered that now.)\n“♪～♪～♪”\n\n“♪～♪～♪”\n\n(Kiryu, I know you&#39;re having fun, but... Please keep the fun to that level.)\n(You guys are the only ones whose actions are too showy. You&#39;re nearly eating up Kanzaki and Sengoku&#39;s stage presence.)\n\n(Ah, that&#39;s right. The climax is gonna be a spotlight on those two, so we shouldn&#39;t get in the way.)\n(Let&#39;s retreat for now, Tetsu.)\n\n(Ossu! I’m overwhelmed with emotion that I got to join forces with Taishou~! ♪)\n\n(Haha. Looks like you didn&#39;t neglect your training even while I was away.)\n(You seem to imitate me all the time, so I wanted you to step away ‘n look at yourself again, Tetsu.)\n(Do you really just wanna be me? No, right? Then find your own path as a man~♪)\n\n(Ossu, I&#39;ll keep that in mind! So that&#39;s what Taishou had in mind all along...)\n(I was real anxious that you started hating me or kept your distance from me ‘cause I was annoying you!)\n\n(Sorry. I felt like over-pampering you wouldn’t be a good idea.)\n(Don&#39;t become a copy of me... Absorb me and Morisawa’s good points— everyone&#39;s good points and become a great man.)\n\n(I told you already, you can’t have your little tryst forever, wrap it up... It&#39;s your turn, Kanzaki, are you ready?)\n(Timing is essential, make sure you make me say “splendid!” ♪)\n\n(Mm, I&#39;ll do my best. But Hasumi-dono, is it okay for me to be in charge of the final scene?)\n(I&#39;m confused because I was only informed about this last minute, and I&#39;m worried I haven&#39;t practiced enough...?)\n\n(Give it a shot. Anything can happen if you try, and nothing will happen if you don&#39;t… That’s how it goes.)\n(I don&#39;t mean to copy Kiryu’s words, but it won&#39;t work if I just spoil you. Man up, Kanzaki.)\n\n(Mm, alright. I can&#39;t face the sun with pride if I only hesitate after having been encouraged so much. Leave it to me, Hasumi-dono—)\n(I will never do anything that would betray your trust.)\n(I will repay your kindness with service. That is my pride, the Japanese valor that I have inherited from my ancestors.)\n(Even if some people laugh at my old-fashioned values, my seniors praise me.)\n(To repay that kindness... Kanzaki Souma will pass through.)\n(Sengoku, are you ready?)\n\n(Yeah, Kanzaki-dono! It’s all OK, I’m ready to go any time~♪)\n\n(It&#39;s a dangerous role, so are you sure you’ll be fine? It&#39;s better not to overdo it because life is at stake here, alright?)\n\n(Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve practiced a lot! Leave it to me, nin-nin~♪)\n(...Ninjutsu and ninpou training are of no use in this modern era.)\n(I’ve spent half my life being constantly scolded by everyone, who told me to do something more constructive— something more realistic.)\n(I had been told that, instead of spending all my pocket money on shuriken or something, I should invest in my future—)\n(That it’s more meaningful to memorize math formulas, chemical symbols, and kanji than to memorize tons of ninja names—)\n(And that&#39;s actually true. Everyone&#39;s opinions are proper and correct.)\n(But… just because everyone is right doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m wrong.)\n(Everyone is different, everyone is good. That is what my comrades RYUSEITAI told me — and alongside them, I will put together a performance for the sake of adding beauty to the stage.)\n(Thinking about it, I’ve accumulated so much training thus far just for this moment.)\n(That thought makes me feel rather satisfied and proud of myself.)\n(No, in fact… To the me from when I hadn’t yet started speaking like a ninja would...)\n(I want to tell the “me” from back then that nothing was ever in vain.)\n\n(Is that so? In that case, I have nothing else to say here. Samurai and ninja are the same; anything you could say to a man with an expression like that is only wasted breath.)\n(Let&#39;s at least treat each other with sincerity.)\n(Now, like usual... Let&#39;s fulfill our duty, ninja of RYUSEITAI.)\n\n(That’s just what I was hoping to hear from you, samurai of AKATSUKI~♪)\n(We each hold our own forms of justice up high.)\n(Kamen Rider and Super Sentai, Showa Rider and Heisei Rider... heroes of American comic book movies, too—)\n(When all of them meet, they have conflicting opinions and clash. However, in the end, they join forces to fight a common enemy. That is the staple of these shows.)\n(Even if the place of birth is different, even if the color of justice is different—)\n(We are surely aiming for the same thing! I will believe in that, and continue to fight in the name of love and peace today and onwards…☆)\n“♪～♪～♪”\n\nChapter 4\n\n“♪～♪～♪”\n(Now, it’s the “kuraimakusu”. The ninjas persistently try to steal the scroll. Even when they slip up and get caught, they manage to free themselves…)\n(The ninjas run about, evading traps as they escape.)\n(We samurai are exhausted, though. Why do we have to work so hard to hide the evidence of our master&#39;s affair…?)\n(Those sorts of thoughts start to get us a little irritated.)\n(On the way to the scroll, there is a rampage at a sake brewery, and alcohol is spilled. Everyone becomes inebriated and starts feeling tipsy.)\n(So they hold a party… and while complaining about their masters, the ninjas and samurai somehow begin to get along well in their excitement.)\n(In such a cheerful atmosphere, the sound of conch shells resounds, calling for war.)\n(That&#39;s right... All of it was a scheme plotted by a neighboring country. They watched like tigers, waiting to attack the castle as soon as the opportunity presented itself.)\n(They filled the wife’s head with words of the lord’s infidelity, cultivating her suspicion.)\n(They prompted internal strife by splitting the castle in half.)\n(They must have thought that if things went well, ninjas hired by his furious wife would simply assassinate the lord.)\n(Even if it didn’t go that far, internal disputes would cause turmoil in the castle…)\n(And because the ninjas had dismantled all of the traps and defenses, the castle is easier to attack.)\n(Thus, due to the scheme, the national power was to be reduced, and the castle’s military strength to be further reduced with the infighting...)\n(The castle was to be overrun by the approaching army of the neighboring country before we knew it.)\n(However, well… the ninjas are so inept, that time has passed without any proper results...)\n(So the army of the neighboring country becomes fed up with waiting, and begins their attack.)\n(However, the castle had been thrown into disorder to some extent, causing confusion...)\n(And while normally, it might have been possible to push through with momentum and take control of the castle…)\n(A miscalculation occurs at that moment. In fact, if the castle lord truly was having an affair...)\n(Then there would’ve been the likelihood that the wife, who wouldn’t listen to any excuse… would have had her entire force, which was half of the castle, defect against the lord.)\n\n(Mm. The lord of the neighboring country seemed to be especially enamored with this castle lord’s wife...)\n(It seems like he was planning to make this lord’s wife his own if things went well. That&#39;s why he told her about her husband&#39;s infidelity.)\n\n(However, our lord was not having an affair. The scroll that was sealed in the secret room of the castle tower… The scroll that he had stubbornly tried to hide…)\n\n(It was filled with a plethora of love poems written about his wife. A massive amount...)\n(It seemed that he didn&#39;t want people to see them, so in his embarrassment, he tried to hide it.)\n(After he reported this, the wife regrets suspecting his affair. The love between the lord and his wife deepens, and their vassals, ninjas and samurai, celebrate it with great joy.)\n(The only hindrance left is the approach of the neighboring country’s army. The marauders who meddle with the happy ending — the love of a close couple…)\n\n(... are destined to pay, and go crashing down into hell!)\n“♪～♪～♪”\n(Both the ninjas and samurai, exhausted from the slapstick drama, do their best to protect their beloved masters...)\n(It’s a spectacular, legitimate performance of battle that vastly overshadows everything up to this point, that it makes you wonder “why were they acting so incompetent earlier, then?”)\n(It&#39;s turning out as one would expect, but that&#39;s just the staple of period dramas!)\n(Making good use of the traps that had harassed them up until this point, and having fought each other, the ninjas and samurai rampage perfectly in sync!)\n(But the enemy is strong, and we are exhausted. One by one... My comrades fall, but I won’t back down!)\n(As long as I have loyalty in my chest, my heart won’t break, even if my sword does!)\n\n\n(As the last surviving young samurai, my arrows run out. My sword breaks. I fall… Then I pick up the sword of my great superior and stand once again.)\n“Heaven’s vengeance is slow but sure!”\n“You ruffians who can&#39;t read the room — if you don&#39;t fear my military might, come at me...!”\n\n(Wow... As expected of Kanzaki-dono, he’s so dignified! It’s magnificent! It&#39;s a super duper cool, prominent show!)\n(He truly is a sight to behold. However, the night sky is lonely when there is only the moon.)\n(I, too, will accompany you! Even though I am in the shadows, I will fight to protect the peace of the people I love!)\n“♪～♪～♪”\n(There are only a few survivors from both the ninjas and samurai. Kanzaki-dono is fighting tooth-and-nail, but he won&#39;t be able to defeat the vast army by himself.)\n(That&#39;s why we need to drive back the enemy in one move.)\n(I’ll take on that task. I will sneak into the enemy camp unseen and cut off the head of the general.)\n(If we defeat the leader, the enemy&#39;s army will either collapse or, at the very least, retreat. It will be our victory.)\n(Everyone who has fallen before… their lives will not be in vain.)\n(Up until now, I&#39;ve been an inexperienced ninja who only ever meekly follows everyone’s backs... That was my role, but now, I have a spotlight scene for myself right at the very end.)\n(No, in fact… I always complain that it&#39;s embarrassing to stand out so much...)\n(Yet I have a place to belong now, given to me by everyone in RYUSEITAI.)\n(They allowed me to openly shout that I like the things I like.)\n(And then welcomed me as a comrade. They let me spend my youth with them laughing, crying, and getting angry together.)\n(If I were to run away from even that place... then that would truly be an embarrassment.)\n(I&#39;m shy and spineless… If something scary happens again, I might cower back.)\n(But for now, while a blade is put on my heart, I’ll face this adversity instead of running away.)\n(Taichou-dono! Shinkai-dono! Tetora:-kun! Midori-kun! I was there the whole time, yet to others, it never seemed that way!)\n(It never mattered to anyone whether I was there or not!)\n\n\n(But it&#39;s completely different now! The five of us are RYUSEITAI! I&#39;m going to keep living on here, too!)\n“♪～♪～♪”\n(Watch me closely! This is my secret finishing move, Ninpou: Ring of Fire Passageway...!)\n(Ahh, it&#39;s so fun and exhilarating!)\n(I never thought something like this would ever come in handy in my whole life! Even Buddha never expected it, a-hahahaha…! ☆)\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ A reference to Pirate Festival.↑ It was more of the word of legends that ninjas would use kites for espionage, but they were used in ancient China for military purposes, among others. Kites were introduced from China to Japan in the seventh century. Read more here.↑ 起承転結 (kishoutenketsu) describes the structure of a narrative. In order, 起句 (kiku) is the introduction of characters and context, 承句 (sho) is the development of the story towards 転句 (ten) the twist, where the story takes an unexpected development, and finally 落ち (ketsu) the conclusion. 序破急 (johakyu) refers to the speed at which events happen. It's typically applied to tea ceremonies, marital arts, or theatre, but I thought the speed of music would better represent what he's talking about.↑ This resembles his 5* Scout quote from !-era.↑ RYUSEITAI (流星隊) means &quot;shooting star squadron&quot;, so the comet imagery has to do with that.↑ He's referring to himself, the Eccentrics, and the events of Meteor Impact. He uses the word ばけもの (bakemono), which were supernatural creatures that could shapeshift.↑ 武士道 (Bushido), or the &quot;way of the warrior&quot;, is the moral code of samurai which dictate the way they carry about their lives. Historically, there were several different codes and practices that samurai would follow, but Bushido can be used as a catch-all for the variety of them. Read more here.↑ Here, Shinobu uses 僕 (boku), a common masculine first-person pronoun, to refer to his old self. Shinobu's first-person pronoun is typically 拙者 (sessha, lit. clumsy person ), an archaic pronoun ninjas used. This whole line comes back in !!-era for Shinobu's Feature Scout story.↑ Souma finishes Shinobu's line. The full saying is from an Edo-era dodoitsu poem: &quot;People who meddle in other's love affairs will get kicked by a horse&quot;.↑ In the original Japanese text, Chiaki says this same line to AKATSUKI when they reunite in Submarine. Cute.↑ A shogi reference.↑ A ninja saying. The kanji for 忍 (ninja) is comprised of a 刃 (blade) on a 心 (heart). Conceptually, the two together represents the act of perserverence: even if there's a blade over their heart, they will get through. Now that's commitment to the bit.

Apparently, the path of the idol is like that real chivalrous path of the yakuza.\n\nI heard from Tetsu...— he&#39;s a junior in my club— it&#39;s a real tearjerker. Can&#39;t let kids or girls see me cry.\n\n... Well, I&#39;ll just watch whatever you brought.\nIt&#39;s a lonely thing, watching stuff all by yourself.\nMy kid sister always pesters me, like, &quot;Watch it with me!&quot;, when there&#39;s a variety show on TV or somethin&#39;. I&#39;m not really interested in that kinda thing, but y&#39;know.\n\nA man doesn&#39;t go back on his word.

Shinobu~!” ♪\n\nSince I was a child, I’ve always been the odd-one-out who loved ninjas...\nI’d always act and talk like a ninja, too. It worried my parents, as I didn&#39;t have any friends for a long time either.\n\nI know they can&#39;t help but be overprotective, but it’s frustrating being treated as a child who can&#39;t do anything.\nI’m already a teenager by now.\nAnzu-dono. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re kind to me, but I&#39;m not a stuffed animal.\nAnd I’m not your little brother either, you know…?\n\n\nOhh, that’s Sengoku’s voice! I see that Anzu’s here too! The two of you are here so early! Wonderful, I can tell you’re both motivated☆\nI also arrived early, and have been making the rounds to greet people while checking the souvenir shops!\nI&#39;m sure you know this, but this tourist spot is also the holy land for tokusatsu...☆4\nYou see, I spotted a Shocker Combatman over there just a minute ago! I got his autograph! Ahh, I&#39;m so happy!\nMy dream has come true~ This will become a family heirloom! Fuhahaha…☆\n\n………\n\n………\n\n…— Sorry! My timing is always, always awful—!\n\nAnzu and Sengoku, embracing each other like that… S- So it’s that kind of relationship, huh? I’m sorry, I don’t want to disturb you! I’ll take my leave!\n\nN-No? Taichou-dono, you’re misunderstanding the situation—!\n\nIt’s alright. I understand.\nTo me, I believe that an idol and a producer together is a thorny road, and as captain, I don’t think I should overlook this love affair, but—!\nNo one can ever stop love!\n\nI give you my blessings! That’s all I can say! I’m rooting for you! Goodbye!\n\nI told you already, you have it wrong, Taichou-dono?! Don’t run off with the wrong idea in your head—! Every once in a while, I’d like you to listen to what people have to say!\n\nChapter 2\n\n………\n\n…………\n………\n\n(T-This is so awkward…! Why am I the first one from RYUSEITAI to get here? Aren’t Sengoku-kun and Morisawa-senpai always the ones to get here first…?)\n(I thought I’d get lost wandering around an unfamiliar place, so I got here early, but…)\n(It&#39;s just the two of us here — Me, and the scary vice president from AKATSUKI…)\n\n(Ahh, I&#39;m so depressed, I want to die... I feel like my own lack of communication skills are to blame...)\n(I can’t just run off somewhere… But I don&#39;t know what to say to someone I don&#39;t know well, either...)\n\n(S-Someone hurry up and get here...! It’s getting hard to breathe...!)\n\nYou. Are you alright? Your complexion doesn’t look good. Are you feeling unwell?\n\nFweh…? Oh, me…? I’m fine, er, probably…?\n\nProbably? Good grief. If you get anxious now, you&#39;ll only wear yourself out. Although, it&#39;s not good to be too relaxed, either.\n...I think the others will be arriving soon, so just wait a little longer.\n\nAh, sure… I’m sorry…?\n\nWhy are you apologizing? We may be upperclassmen and underclassmen, but we’re about the same age in the end, and we’re performing a joint live together, so...\nI’m not saying you should act overly familiar with me, but you don’t have to feel sorry like that..\n\nAh, okay… I’m so sorry…\n\nI just said you don’t need to apologize, though… You. Let me see that bag for a bit.\n\nFweh…? Eh? What do you mean…? I-Is it a violation of the school rules in some way?\n\nNo. Show me the plush hanging off of it. This is Hanzoumon, isn’t it?\n\nAh, yeah… While I was on the way to our meeting spot, I saw it was on sale, so I bought it without thinking. Our eyes kinda met, y’know…♪\n\nIs that so? Sorry, but let me have a good look.\nRight now, I’m putting together different key points that I couldn’t fit in the pamphlet.\nI’m thinking of making flyers of that information, and handing copies of it out for free, but...\nRather than just listing it out, I figured it would be easier to read it in manga form where Hanzoumon explains the information.\n\nConsidering that a lot of families with children come to this tourist spot.\nBut, I only have a faint recollection of its design, so I’d like to draw it while looking at the real thing.\n\nAhh, I was wondering what you were drawing a moment ago... Er, I&#39;ll put the Hanzomon plush here, if that’s fine...?\n\nThat’s helpful. Thank you.\n\n………\n\nWhat? Why are you staring? I assure you, I’ve been given permission to use Hanzoumon’s design. Once I finish the flyer, I’ll check again.\n\nNo, it’s just… You’re really good at drawing, aren’t you…?\n\nIt’s the work of an amateur5. I don’t have any art supplies right now, so I have no choice but to draw in an app on my tablet. I’m not accustomed to it, so the lines are shaky…\nGhh… if only I’d practiced a little more on digital…\n\nIt’s kinda unexpected. I always thought Vice President-san was a serious honor student…\n\nThere is no law that says honor students can’t draw. You. It seems like you like yuru-characters, hm?\nHow about I draw something for you? I’d like a good warm-up to get my fingers used to digital art.\n\nAh, then… Hikonyan…♪\n\nThat Akazonae character?6 I only have a faint memory of that one too… Isn’t it the one that looks like mochi?\n\nAh— I have a key strap…\nMy parents travel all around the country to buy vegetables, so I always ask them to buy me a yuru-character souvenir from wherever they go~♪\n\nMidori-ku~n! Mornin’! ☆\n\nWoah—! Y-You startled me. Morning, Tetora-kun…?\n\nYo! You looked like you were having fun talking about somethin’. Did I interrupt you guys?\n\nNo, no… It’s a relief you came, Tetora-kun. I don’t know how to talk to someone older than me…\n\nReally? Aren’t you always bantering with Taichou? You aren’t together today?\nAt times like this, I feel like Taichou always goes to pick you up or somethin’, Midori-kun ♪\n\nNo… Morisawa-senpai has been somehow getting closer and closer with my parents…\nI felt like it’ll get out of hand if it continues any further, so I’ve been telling him lately, “Don’t come to my house”...\nI don’t want that guy to disturb even the peace of my own home…\n\nChapter 3\n\nAhaha, it&#39;s a luxury to get to worry about that kind of thing, Midori-kun. Personally, even if I ask Taishou, he doesn’t come to my house, so I‘m the one who goes to his, even if he never asked.\nWe came together today, too~♪\n\nDon’t come to my place too much, Tetsu... My neighborhood isn’t that safe.\nWe do wanna move, though… I worry about my sister too, so I drop her off every morning and pick her up later.\n\nGood morning, Kiryu. It feels like it&#39;s been a while. Are you in top shape?\n\nWho do you think you’re talking to? C’mon, that’s my line…\nI&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine since it’s you, but if you end up lookin’ pathetic, I&#39;ll knock you off stage.\n\nHeh. Rest assured, today I’m—... no. AKATSUKI is in top shape as always.\nHowever, that Kanzaki… even though I went to the trouble of appointing him as the representative of AKATSUKI...\nIn the end, Kiryu and I got paired to play the lead roles for the AKATSUKI side of the performance, so I did encounter some difficulties.\nIn fact, the two of us had a lot more stage blocking than usual, so I had trouble learning the routine.\nAt this rate, it seems like there was no point in leaving everything to Kanzaki.\nI was hoping that he would take on becoming the center of AKATSUKI, but...\nKanzaki is pretty subservient, it seems. If anything, he tries to bolster us up so much that it puts himself down in the process. It’s troubling.\nEven though he&#39;s a kid who can do it if he tries…\n\nHaha. That just means he holds us in high regard and treats us with respect. Isn’t that a blessing? Well, that also means we can’t ever perform poorly.\n\nThat’s true… Anyhow, so Kanzaki still hasn’t shown his face yet?\nHe&#39;s very precise with his time, and always arrives at the scene before anyone else, but…\nI don’t see him anywhere. I’m worried… Did any of you see him on your way here?\n\nNo, I haven’t. I did pass by Taichou, Sengoku-kun and Anzu-anego, though.\nWhen I called out to them, they said they’d meet up with us later, so I&#39;m sure they’ll show up soon.\n\nWhat about Shinkai-senpai…? That guy’s pretty loose with time, so I&#39;m worried that he might be late...?\nIf anything, I think he’s the one that needs escorting from Morisawa-senpai…\nThose two seem to be close friends, but… there’s something about that that they’re distant about. Like, doesn’t it feel like they’ve drawn a certain line between each other…?\n\nMaybe it’s ‘cause there’s a different sense of distance when it comes to someone your age, and someone who’s your junior?\nSame for you Midori-kun, wouldn&#39;t it be uncomfortable if I picked you up every morning? Like, “we’re peers, so don&#39;t act like a guardian~”, or something?\n\nNot really, I wouldn’t mind if it were you, Tetora-kun... Unlike Morisawa-senpai, you don&#39;t push my personal boundaries or anything...\n\nYeah, that’s my point exactly; that’s the different sense of distance you get from someone of the same age, yeah?\n\nThat&#39;s an interesting conversation, but it&#39;s time for all of us to start heading to the stage. Otherwise, our progress will be hindered.\nWe’ll try to contact Kanzaki, so you all, check on the status of the other RYUSEITAI members.\n\nAhh, roger that! Midori-kun, do you know Shinkai-senpai’s phone number?\n\nYeah, I know it… I picked out a cute smartphone for Shinkai-senpai&#39;s birthday...\nI was the only one who forgot about his birthday and didn’t prepare a present for him in time, so I got it for him to make up for my mistake...7\nJust a sec, I’ll give him a call…\n… Ah. Hello…? Shinkai-senpai…?\n\nye~s, hellooo~♪\n— Huh? That voice is surprisingly close?!\n\nOi. In that river over there… isn’t that Shinkai?\n\npuka, puka…~♪\n\nUwaa— What are you doing, Shinkai-senpai?! We’re not at school right now, so please don’t do anything so weird~!\nThey’ll call the police on you!\n\n\nahaha. my, my, [tetora]... you say the kinds of things [chiaki] does, don&#39;t you?\n\nI think that&#39;s a completely proper comment to make.\nShinkai, if you misbehave, you’ll only give trouble to your unit, even your juniors. Get a hold of yourself, you’re incorrigible.\n\naren’t you bossy~ When my skin gets [dry], it gets suffocating for me.\nalso, [frog-san] was here, so I thought I’d give Shinobu a [present]~♪\nthat kid loves [froggies], so… hop, hop…~♪\nwhen it was my birthday, everyone [celebrated] with me, yes?

I don’t have the free time for it either.\n\nFirst of all, if the student council were to strike back with concerted efforts, you all would be obliterated on the spot.\nUnfortunately, it’d be too much trouble to go to those lengths, so I’m overlooking the matter… I’m simply going along with Eichi’s whim.\n\nThe Student Council leads this school. Firm rule and order can only be held up by immovable rules and pride.\nThe student council is absolute, as is the will of its leader, the president.\n\nSince the president has decided that we should set you all free… All I’ll do is follow that order.\n\nI am Eichi’s right hand. Hands don’t think. I will sacrifice my head for Eichi’s vision.\nPersonally, I&#39;d like to deal with troublemakers in the academy as soon as possible.\n\nDon’t push your luck, problem child.\nYou all want to be able to play terrorist and revolution like it’s nothing… Even so, we’ll be overlooking it.\nKnow your place, and commit it to heart to not incur the wrath of the student council.\nThe moment the opportunity presents itself and there is justice to be had, my retribution will be relentless.\n\nHonestly, the way Eichi thinks is beyond the realm of anyone else…\nWhy he leaves such obvious hindrances and obstacles unattended, I don’t know. Perhaps it’s the complacency of a king, but he’s playing around too much.\nI get that if all we do is cut the fat and throw it out, the entire body won’t be able to maintain itself.\n\nYou all may be ne’er-do-wells. but you’re still students of Yumenosaki Academy.\nYou’re the blood and cells of the academy, so to speak. If we do away with you just because you&#39;re unnecessary, there won’t be anything left.\nI get the rationale, but suppose you guys are the cancer cells eating away at the whole body like worms instead...\n\n… Oi. Hold it, where do you plan on going?\nI’m not finished talking to you yet. If a story has an introduction, development, turn and conclusion1, we’re only a third of the way through the introduction.\nHmph. It’s certainly true that to speak in the library goes against its moral principles. It can’t be helped, we’ll set aside the proper time to continue this conversation later.\nI have piles of things to say to you all— especially you.\nThat aside, let’s circle back to what I wanted to ask you in the first place… what business do you have in the library?\n\nHmm, you’re looking for materials to put together a report. Come to think of it, I heard that you transferred here from an ordinary school, hm?\nIf that’s the case, I’m sure keeping up with classes will be a challenge.\n\nBut, dare I say, don’t be this incredibly insolent.2\nThis school specializes on the prejudiced culture of the entertainment industry, the logic behind it, just about everything and everything–\nThe knowledge you’ll get from things like books won’t amount to much.\n\nWhen it comes to double-checking something, there’s nothing more handy than a “walking encyclopedia” so to speak. If there’s something you don’t get, asking someone else is a good shortcut.\nA true intellectual is someone who’s well-in-the-know about who knows what.\n\nMany of the teachers here at the academy are former top idols who enjoyed success and glory in their prime.\nMost of the questions you have can be resolved by asking one and listening to what they have to say.\n\nIf it&#39;s something basic, I can explain it to you.\nNo, if anything, ask me. You can talk to me. I can show you what you do know and what you don’t know in precise detail.\nI wouldn’t consider it “helping an enemy in need” or anything. You get far, far more out of being able to square off against a stronger opponent when it comes to self-improvement, is all.\n\nIt’s that sort of thing. You should listen to me, for my sake.\n\nWell, brace yourself. It may seem like I’m harassing you, but on top of being extensively useful, I&#39;ll be having a very very very long talk with you.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n ↑ 起承転結 (kishoutenketsu) describes the structure of a narrative.

You and us in the Student Council are mutual enemies. … No, that’s not the right way of putting it. I’ll amend that.\n\nAs the student council, your mutiny isn’t even worthy of being a pebble in our path. It’s not worth discussing.\nHowever, if you’re going to oppose me directly, I have thoughts of my own.\n\nTo present soybeans in front of me, of all people… Eichi may have his remarks, but this isn’t something I can accept.\nWhat is it? It’s pointless trying to pull together a defense for yourself at this poin… What? “You don’t like soybeans?”, you say?\n\nAre you making me have to explain it, you? You saw my reaction, and you’re still looking for an explanation?\nYour absolute incapacity to comprehend anything that’s going on– It goes beyond astonishment, I’m impressed by it.\nFine. If you still don’t understand after I’ve said this much, I’ll explain.\n\nI hate soybeans. I suppose you could say I hate them to the point of complete and utter contempt.\nAnd then you showed me soybeans. It’s hard to put the rage I felt that instant into words.\n\nIt&#39;s too late to ask for forgiveness at this point. Listen here, Transfer Student.

This place is a real hidden gem.\n… What’re ya hankerin’ for, Lil’ Miss? Bread roll ‘n croquette1 and a jam sandwich?\n\nThe jam sandwiches are probably runnin’ out by now, and the bread rolls are the most popular item on the menu.\nGimme a sec.

Come to think of it, how much was it… The jam sandwich was 120 yen, and the bread roll ‘n croquette was 180, maybe…?\nI don&#39;t remember, and I don&#39;t need the money.

Just before the opening of the auditions\n\n\n     Location: Dome Pathway\n\n\nWhooa~! This venue’s suuuper big!\nIt&#39;s seriously too bad we can&#39;t go in and see it...! Even the evaluation seems super large-scale!\n\n\nFufu. Are you surprised by the scope of this event?\nThunderbolt is certainly a large international corporation, but you and I have just as much financial power to be able to execute the same feats.\nIf we don&#39;t think that we’re capable of doing what an overseas company can do, then I’d worry about our future, mm?\n\nBesides, if I may say so as someone in the same line of business, I don&#39;t think it’s acceptable to prepare a facility of this scale just for the sake of 4piece.\nIt&#39;s a gaudy, tasteless structure, built to show off the power of Thunderbolt.\n\n\nFufufu, it’s less like the words of someone in the same business, and more like slander at this point!\nThe way you speak about it makes it seem as if you don’t take Thunderbolt seriously, but you mustn’t critique them. They’re the ones actually arranging and holding the event, after all.\nIt’s tacky to stick your nose into it too much, isn’t it?\n\nHe’s not tacky! Eichi-sama’s always cool!\n\nHehe. Thanks for the tip. Perhaps I’d gotten jealous that Thunderbolt had caught Tori&#39;s interest.\nHowever, I&#39;m also anticipating the proverbial ships moving in1.\nTheir movements have purpose: it seems that they’re trying to scoop up the talent that ES failed to pick up in my place.\nThat&#39;s exactly why I didn&#39;t forbid the members of fine from participating, so I gave Tori my approval for him to participate.\n\nI just didn’t think I’d have to pull out, since I got so busy with ATLANTIS…~2\nIt&#39;s only at a time like this that all sorts of construction issues came up... It really is unlucky.\n\n\nPlease don&#39;t be so discouraged. Even if you couldn’t pursue an audition like this one, there is still a place of belonging for you, Young Master.\nYou only have one body, so it may be best for you to focus on your new business.\n\nYeah... If I don&#39;t get it together, the construction schedule for ATLANTIS might get stopped again3.\nI don&#39;t know if you truly do wanna do this, but you said you&#39;re doing it &quot;for my sake&quot;, so I&#39;ll support you.\n\nThank you very much, Himegimi.\nThis humble Hibiki Wataru will make the best of it and put on a show for Himegimi’s sake.\nAnd so. Please do your best too, Himegimi.\n\nYeah! Of course! ‘Cuz I won&#39;t accept it if you fall behind right from the start!\n\nI&#39;ll be rooting you on from the sidelines as well. I hope you&#39;ll show off the fullest extent of your true abilities, Hibiki-sama.\n— Young Master. It’s about that time.\n\nEh, already?! Uuu, I wanted to soak in the ambiance of the venue at the very least~\n\nWell, do your best, Hibiki-senpai! You gotta tell me all about your thoughts after!\n\n\n… Fufu. Himegimi and Butler-san seem quite busy themselves. I must give them my thanks for coming to see me off.\n\nBy the way, what are you going to do after this, Eichi?\nI&#39;m sure I heard that you have a job you want to prioritize over the auditions.\n\nYes. I also plan to watch 4piece as an audience member on the other side of the TV, so I&#39;m going back to ES to clear up my backlogged work until nightfall.\nBut, there&#39;s something I want to give you before all that.\nYou remember this mask, don’t you?4\n\nYes. I haven’t forgotten it for even a moment. Because this is me and myself.\nBut... You wanted me to continue being an idol. You accepted this mask alongside that wish, so why have you entrusted it with me again?\n\nIt’s something like a “good luck charm”, perhaps.\nYou always carry out the role I want from you.\nBut, to achieve the results the organizers of 4piece want, you can’t afford to keep juggling that with your connection with me and fine.\nIt will certainly be a series of difficult decisions.\n\nI hope you&#39;ll see this mask as something that temporarily gives you the free will to make choices for yourself during the 4piece auditioning.\nFor that time, I want you to forget that you&#39;re a member of fine and face the evaluation as yourself.\n\nOf course, after 4piece is over, I&#39;ll have you return it.\n\nThank you, Eichi. I’m sorry to have troubled you.\nShould there ever come a point I’d like to act however I want and feel your support, I&#39;ll take the privilege to don this mask~♪\n\nFufu. I figured that because it was you, you&#39;d turn it down and say something like &quot;I&#39;ll just accept your feelings”. But it seems that was an unnecessary concern.\n\nWell then, you’ll have to excuse me as I take my leave.\nKeito seems to be participating in 4piece too, so I’ll be going over and poking my nose in his business as a breather.\nWataru, I&#39;m not worried about you at all. Do your best until the very end.\n\nPlease worry a little, Eichi! That would be lonesome in itself!\n\nAhaha. I have complete confidence in you, Wataru. Because whether you pass or fail, you&#39;ll always be someone I look up to.\nWell, I&#39;ll go and do a little catching up with an old friend.\nWataru. I’m looking forward to you livening up 4piece as the eye of the storm~♪\n\n\n     Location: Passageway Inside the Dome\n\n\n……\n(I’m… not nervous, strangely enough.)\n(Well, I suppose that would be the case. I&#39;m used to being in the eyes of the public to begin with, so it&#39;s no different from usual.)\n(Even if it&#39;s a place where I&#39;m being evaluated.)\n\n\nOhh, you came too, Keito-chin?\nI won’t lose to you, y’know~ But we’re both from RhyLin, so I don’t want us crushing each other completely, either.\n\nYes. I’m also going with the intention to win, so prepare yourself.\nWe&#39;ve been battling in live shows since our days at the academy. The format may be different this time, but I&#39;ll do it without holding back like always.\nWe AKATSUKI have just gained success through “Rumbling Heaven and Earth R”5. With that momentum, we&#39;ll take over the whole world— everything under heaven in 4piece too.\n\nAhaha. &quot;Everything under heaven&quot;, huh — You’re still influenced by the words from the history program, aren’t you?\nWell, there’s no shortage of opponents either.\n\nMhm. Wataru’s coming from fine to participate too~\n\n\nN-Nya!? T-T-T-Tenshouin, how long have you been thwere?!\nDon’t tell me you’re participating in 4piece too?\n\nYou seem pretty astonished, Nito-kun. If things like this catch you off guard, you won&#39;t be able to handle an audition full of unpredictabilities, now will you?\nUnfortunately, I&#39;m not skilled enough to conceal my presence. I just got here.\nBut I caught what you were saying for a bit. You were commenting on the other participants, weren&#39;t you?\n\nYou heard wrong. It’s nothing more than small talk.\n\nWhat’re you doing here, anyways? I heard you weren&#39;t going to be participating in 4piece...\nIf you&#39;re just here to loiter, do me a favor and go away. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to come and get in my way before I go audition.\n\nFufu. Don&#39;t say that, Keito. Aren’t we close?\n\nIt’s like you said, I don&#39;t intend to participate in the audition program.\nTo make the most of what little life I have left, I don&#39;t have the time to leave my evaluation to others. I&#39;ll be content just watching the tournament of idols from afar.\nBut, I wanted to give my childhood friend a head’s up.\n\nHead’s up?\n\nYes. As the head of the ES steering committee, I was the first to know which idols would be assigned to the same venue as you two.\nBesides Wataru, it looks like another notable person will be assigned to the same venue as you both.\nTaki Ibuki-kun, who has become temporarily affiliated with ES一\nOf all the new temporary affiliated idols, he’s the one with the most capabilities.\nHe may perform just as wellー no, even better than I expect him to.\n\nChapter 2\n\n     The 3rd venue of 4piece, known as the Twin Rooster Pagoda\n\n\n“Welcome, everyone! This is the third venue of 4piece– the Twin Rooster Pagoda!”\n&quot;From here on out, we will have you square it out in the Twin Rooster Pagoda... Well, that’s what I’d like to say.&quot;\n&quot;But there’s one aspect of this venue that’s different from all the others.&quot;\n&quot;In front of the screen before you lay wood tokens6, one for each person. Would each of you take one for me?&quot;\n\n\nMm, I’ve made sure to take one.\n\nThere seems to be a picture of a bird on the other side of it, though. Could this be a tally?\n\n“Hehe. Seems that you noticed it right away, Amagi Hiiro-kun. How Nice!&quot;\n\n&quot;For those of you who don&#39;t know what a tally is, I&#39;ll explain. A tally is a board that has writings or drawings on it, that’s then broken apart. It’s used as a receipt to prove that you are the rightful party related to a transaction.&quot;\n“For our purposes, we&#39;ll be using these tallies to determine pairs.&quot;\n&quot;The Twin Rooster Tower’s competition is a tag-team battle, and so those of you with perfectly matching tallies will compete as partners and be evaluated together as such.&quot;\n\nI see. So, I&#39;ll be paired with the person who has the other half of the hawk picture.\nAnybody! Is there anybody who fits my tally? Whoever has the hawk tally, please speak up!\n\n\nOhh, I got the hawk too.\nLooks like we’re gonna be partners this time. I’m excited to work with you, Hiiro-chin.\nAs for me, feel free to call me &quot;Ni~chan&quot; ♪\n\nI only have one Nii-san. Can I call you “Teenii-san” instead?7\n\nDon’t call me “teeny”! I’m self-conscious about that!\n\nHm? If I’ve upset you, then I apologize. Sorry, “Nazuna-senpai”.\n\n… Hm. Nito and Amagi are paired up? When it comes to something they’ve got in common, they’re both quick to move.\n\nIt looks like the picture I took was a peacock…\nWho else has the other half of the peacock?\n\n\nPeacock? That makes me your partner~!8\n\nMhmhm. These two halves fit snugly together! No doubt about it~♪\nYou’re Hasumi-san from AKATSUKI, right~?\n\nYou’re Taki Ibuki… aren’t you? You know who I am?\n\nThat should be my line~? How does Hasumi-san of all people know me?\n\nYou’re a temporary affiliate of ES. Because of that, I’ve heard about all of that from Eichi, STARPRO’s representative.\nParticularly about you, Taki. I’ve heard that you’re quite the standout in terms of skill, even among the temporary affiliates.\nI didn’t think we’d suddenly be put together as a pair, but I have high expectations concerning you as well.\n\nNyahaha. That’s Hasumi-san alright, well in the know~♪ So, sounds like l’m actually famous around here, surprisingly?\nI’ll do my best to live up to your expectations, Hasumi-san~♪ You’re AKATSUKI’s leader, right? So I’ll rely on you for all sorts of things, ‘kay~?\n— Looks like Keito-chin found his pair too.\n\nI’ve never seen that person before, though. Was there a guy like that in ES?\n\nHis name is Taki Ibuki. He’s one of the current temporary ES idols.\n\nAhh, he’s the Taki that Tenshouin was talking about… Hiiro-chin, you know him?\n\nYes. Though I’d call it just a passing acquaintance.\nI don’t know what he’s truly capable of, but his physical ability was impressive.9 The way he carries himself makes it seem like he’s fond of martial arts.\n\nI see…~ Keito-chin’s brains meet him in the middle, so it might be a good pair.\n\nBut. The most troublesome people in the venue are those two.\n\nThis seriously can’t be happening!\n\n\nOh, it’s happening ☆\nMy tally combined with yours makes for the cutest picture of a dove.\nLet’s aim for that qualification together, Knight-san~♪\n\nHold on, Hibiki. We&#39;re going to be paired up, and yet you can’t even call me by name?\nI recognize your abilities, but there&#39;s no way I can synergize with an eccentric weirdo like this. I’m getting worried about what’s in store already!\n\n“It seems you’ve all found your partners, hm?”\n\n“Partners”? We’ve been forced together into pairs, you think we’re going to swallow being “partners” down easy? This has got to be some kind of joke.\nLike, for one thing, I heard that 4piece was an individually-centered competition, so why are we being put together into pairs?\n\nOh, my days! How cruel, Knight-san! I&#39;ve always wanted to team up with you, you know!\n\nI know you’re not being sincere, you clown…!\n\n“Heheh. Seems there are a few competitors who aren&#39;t happy with the tag-team concept, mm?”\n“It&#39;s hard to give your all in a match that&#39;s so dependent on your partner... I suppose there’s some truth to that.”\n“However, if I may say this as the chief executive of 4piece — I think it would be most appropriate to have you all be put in pairs given the evaluation criteria of this venue.”\n“After all, I want you all to face off against an audience of one hundred people.”\n\nChapter 3\n\n“An audience of a hundred people”...\n… Could I ask what that means?10 When the judges were introduced a second ago, I didn’t feel like there were one hundred people in the judges’ seats.\n\n“So you noticed. Always keeping a good eye on your surroundings, as expected of Nito-kun~♪”\n“The judges who I introduced a moment ago are a part of the 4piece review board, and they’ll still be involved.”\n“But, when it comes to how the Twin Rooster Pagoda competition works, you will be evaluated by one hundred guest judges.”\n\nI see. So, “an audience of one hundred”... that’s what that’s referring to, then?\n\n“Yes. So how should you tackle the Twin Rooster Pagoda? From here on out, I’ll demonstrate while I explain it to you.”\n“On each floor of the Twin Rooster Pagoda, there is a large screen as big as the one that I am being projected on. On that screen is each pair’s Score– which shows the total amount of points you’ve obtained.”\n“Do you see where there’s a [0] displayed in the column that says [Nito Nazuna and Amagi Hiiro]?”\n\nYes. The other pairs all have [0]s marked too.\n\n“This number changes based on the outcomes of the competition.”\n“The number of [hearts] given to you by the one hundred judges is key to the evaluation of the whole venue.”\n“There are other finer details in the rules, but it’s better if you see it for yourselves.”\n“First, let’s have all of the participants make their appeals and introduce themselves to the viewers at home!”\n“Will you lead the charge for us, Nito-kun, Amagi-kun?”\n\nY-Yes!\n\nIt started so suddenly… Are you ready, Hiiro-chin?\n\nOf course. I can’t lie, I feel that the explanation is lacking in regards to what self-introduction I’m being asked for, but...\nGetting to be the first ones to do it will be useful for our appeal to the audience. Aira also said that the impression you leave on an audition program is deeply important.\n\nOoh. You know quite a bit about audition programs, don&#39;t you, Hiiro-chin?\n\nYeah. Aira showed me all sorts of old audition programs. It was like preparation or coaching or something… Either way, he’s shown me a lot of them.\nI was lucky enough to work under ES right away, and many of the people around me were from Yumenosaki Academy, too.\nSo I was moved by the way everyone pushed each other hard to get their chance to debut.\n\nWell, that’s ‘cause Yumenosaki’s special in all sorts of ways, right~?\nIn exchange for the debut that came guaranteed with enrollment, self-promotion and starting from the bottom was compulsory.\nUnlike 4piece, successful candidates aren’t given extensive promotion, either.\n\nBut it’s exactly ‘cause of that that it&#39;s a rare opportunity to get to appear on an audition program, and that makes it fun.\nIf you keep up that attitude, Hiiro-chin, you should do fine with 4piece too. Let&#39;s keep our cool and make our introduction~♪\n\nEveryone who’s watching at home! I&#39;m Amagi Hiiro! I serve as the sovereign leader of ALKALOID!\nI&#39;ll do my best to convey my charm during 4piece, so please lend me your support!\n\n“Fufu. What a dignified, unwavering appeal, as expected of Amagi-kun. That’s truly Nice. ”\n&quot;Today&#39;s theme is making both a self-introduction and an appeal to impress the viewers.&quot;\n“The fact that you didn&#39;t hesitate means that you have a clear idea of ​​how to present yourself.&quot;\n\nHm? I didn’t think that far ahead.\n\nBut a world-class producer is skilled at putting idols&#39; charm into words, huh? Thank you, NiceP.\n\nWell then, I’m next up.\nI’m Nito Nazuna! I felt as though I wanted to try out being under NiceP’s production in order to draw out my personal qualities, so that why I’m participating here in 4piece!\nThank you for your shupport!\n\n– Gh, I fumbled my words…! And it was going so well…!\n\n“Splendid! Nito-kun’s employed the speech impediment he’s been gradually overcoming, and it seems to have left an impression on the audience!”\n\nTh-Thank you very much…?\n\nHeheh. As expected of Nazuna-senpai. It wasn’t just a flawless self-introduction, but a way to impress the audience with your individuality.\n\nI didn’t plan on doing that, though… Well whatever, it turned out alright in the end, I guess?\n\nHm? That felt like it had some weight, Nazuna-senpai. Is there something bothering you?\n\nEr, it’s a personal matter. Don’t worry about it.\n\n“Now, then. Now that Amagi-kun and Nito-kun have given their self-introductions and made their appeals, please take a look at the screen.”\n“Do you all see where the [heart] emoji is pictured, across from their names?”\n“Beside it is the number [60]. This demonstrates that out of one hundred people, a favorable impression was made on sixty of them.”\n“In the Twin Rooster Pagoda, the pair with the fewest [hearts] will be announced after the day’s evaluation ends. The lowest placing pair will drop out midway through the evaluation.”\n“And then, after six days of appealing to the audience, the pair that makes it to the top of the tower will be able to participate in the live show on the seventh day.”\n“I would like for the two of you to work together and advance while earning points.”\n&quot;Will the two of you make up for each other&#39;s weak points, or will you compete against each other to reach greater heights? As partners, I would like for you to discuss amongst each other and decide.&quot;\n“Either way, the audience of a hundred people changes out each day, so only those who can make a good impression on each of them can continue to appeal to the end.”\n“The theme is– “Satisfy the largest audience”!”\n“Together with your partner, prove that you are an idol who can spread love and peace to the whole world…☆”\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe judges are an audience of a hundred people that change out every day?\nIt seems like a good way to gauge an idol&#39;s charm, since it’d be with people who don&#39;t necessarily favor them.\nEveryone will be judged fairly, regardless of how well-known they are.\n\nI&#39;ve worked hard on making AKATSUKI accessible to people of all ages, too. All I can do is believe that all that effort will pay off.\n\nHasumi-san, what’re you grumbling about to yourself? You’re a strange one, huh~?\nThe other participants have started introducing themselves, so we should get to it soon, right~?\n\nYeah, of course I plan to. But, you can’t obtain a high score without looking at the whole situation.\nSo far, Nito&#39;s appeal showed off his weakness and made a lasting impression, so we should appeal with that kind of approach, too.\n\nHmmm? You’ve got all sortsa thoughts in your head~ Hasumi-san.\nBut, you won&#39;t get anywhere if you just think about it. Sometimes it&#39;s important to take things head on, y’know~?\n\nReady to cause a rebellion, ready to pick a fight, I’m the descendant of an oni 11 that can silence even crying children.\nEven if it means sending down a rain of blood, I&#39;ll get what I want, when I want it~♪\n\nDon&#39;t say such disturbing things, Taki. There&#39;s nothing to gain in starting an unnecessary fight.\n\nBut, you do have a point in what you’re saying too.\nThere’s no point in being cautious and letting a golden opportunity12 slip by. I hold the same feelings about tackling 4piece. As partners, we need to be in sync.\n\nMhmhm. That’s good~ Well then, I’ll go~♪\nI’m Taki Ibuki! I’m an idol born in Okinawa and raised in America~♪\nNassan invited me to participate in 4piece, so I’m sure very few people know me!\n‘Cuz of that, do me a favor and remember me tons from here on out, okay~?\n\nAlright! Hasumi-san’s up next!\n\n(That Taki guy, he gave such an innocuous self-introduction. He was talking in such a disturbing way, I definitely expected he’d do something extreme.)\n\nI am Hasumi Keito. I act as the leader of the Japanese-style unit AKATSUKI.\n\nYo, you’re the big kahuna!\n\nThis time around, as a solo idol, I intend to put all my experience up until now to good use in order to pass the audition.\n\nThat’s so Hasumi-san! A declaration of victory! Ain’t that just the coolest~♪\n\nWith your support, I–\n\nSo don’t miss out on the fight the Taki-Hasumi pair’s gonna put up~♪\n\n… Oi, Taki. Don’t butt into my self-introduction. If you keep cutting in, it&#39;ll make it look as if my appeal’s fallen flat...!\n\nEh~? All I wanted to do was liven up Hasumi-san&#39;s introduction, y’know?\n\nBut, Hasumi-san&#39;s self-introduction was a little too serious and vanilla~ If anything, it might have been better that I cut in?\n\nWho told you to ever do that—...\n\nBut it looks like we got a good amount of [hearts], right~?\nMaybe Hasumi-san’s serious disposition and my looseness together made us look like an interesting pair~♪\n\nMnm... I’m not pleased that you interrupted my appeal, but…\nIt’s not that I can’t understand your point too: I&#39;m the kind of person who takes things too seriously, after all.\nThings that are flexible are capable of tying down the strong 13 . Maybe there&#39;s something I can gain from pairing up with you.\n\n… Now then. It seems everyone has made their self-introductions.\nThat just leaves us left, but… how shall we go about this?\n\nWhy not go first then?\nYour self-introduction’ll probably leave a lasting impression on the entire audience. Since it&#39;s a pair competition, the result’ll be decided from the start.\nIt’s apparently just a demonstration this time, so why don&#39;t you go all out and show them what you’ve got?\n\nAre you sure? If I go all out, it will likely blow away the impression you make when you do yours after.\n\n...However, it’s more sound than being told to fall on the sword for the sake of Knight-san’s appeal. Understood.\nNow, now, ladies and gentlemen! Please lend me your ear! This unworthy Hibiki Wataru will provide you with the best entertainment!\nAllow me to show you a self-introducing appeal that will make you regret closing your eyes for a single second...☆\n\nChapter 5\n\n&quot;Now then, with that, all of the participants finished their self-introduction appeals.&quot;\n&quot;In particular, Hibiki-kun’s self-introduction was magnificent.&quot;\n\n&quot;He received an astounding 97 hearts—&quot;\n&quot;There’s no single person who’s liked by everyone. Even if they&#39;re an idol.&quot;\n&quot;That&#39;s how intricate the world is. The tastes of society are diverse and varied, and they don&#39;t fit into simple molds.&quot;\n&quot;If you can earn favor from more than 90% of the audience of a hundred people, I think that&#39;s something to take pride in, don&#39;t you?&quot;\n\n&quot;At any rate, you’ll make continuous appeals to the audience of a hundred people like this, and at the end of each day, there will be an interim presentation.&quot;\n&quot;The audition screening of this very venue is about picking out the strengths of each pair throughout and finding out what the audience is looking for.&quot;\n&quot;As for me, while I’d love to watch everyone&#39;s audition until the end, it has been decided for this venue that the lowest ranking pair will be eliminated each time.&quot;\n\n&quot;Naturally… “Individual points” will be given to those who are eliminated, so there&#39;s no need to feel down even if you’re last.&quot;\n“I want you all to fight with all your might, as far as the rules allow, until the very end. That is my wish.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all of the explanation I have for you. From here on out, you’ll all be presented with a theme.&quot;\n&quot;I’d like for each pair to interpret the theme’s contents as they see fit and continue to appeal to the audience of a hundred.”\n&quot;Good luck to all of you in the Twin Rooster Pagoda!”\n\n…Huh, I see. So we need to guess what kind of people the audience of a hundred are and act accordingly.\nWhich means we may have gotten a bit of a late start.\n\nHm? I don&#39;t think so, but...\nWhat area feels dissatisfying for you, Nazuna-senpai?\n\nIt’s because I didn&#39;t set out for the self-introduction appeal to be favorable a second ago. It just so happened that my speech impediment was appreciated.\nWell, we only got 60 hearts. It looks like it’ll be a tight game for us from here on out.\n\nReally? I think everyone, including the audience, withheld their valuation mostly because we were the first to make our appeal, that’s all.\nSeeing his reaction and how his eyes shone, I have no doubt that we should be upfront with our appeals.\n\nAh~ Well, I don't think that person’s reaction is very indicative of anything.\n\n‘Cause NiceP pinpoints an idol’s good points and praises them instantly~ I feel like if I just take it at face value, I&#39;ll get burned somewhere down the line.\nIt’s just that the explanation we heard just now made me even more sure of that thought, I guess, so…\n\nWell, moving on, Hiiro-chin... It looks like the next theme will be announced soon~\nNext time, let’s not be the first to go. We’ll wait back a little and see how it goes before we take our turn.\nWe may be able to see if it’s best that we’re one of the first or the last to make our appeal… Based on the trend, that is.\n\nMm. I&#39;ll follow Nazuna-senpai&#39;s opinion.\nYou have a longer career as a performer, and that makes you more qualified to lead. I don&#39;t mind if you use my opinion solely as a reference.\nThe lowest ranking pair will be eliminated — in other words, it also means that it&#39;s fine as long as we’re not last. Let&#39;s take our time and build up our popularity.\n\n\n“Good day, everyone.”\n&quot;Nice-kun has gone to the other venues to give his explanations, so I’ll be taking over for a while and announcing the theme.&quot;\n\n“I apologize that Nice-kun can’t be here with us, as he’s giving explanations one-by-one by order from the first venue.”\n&quot;However, recording will continue even while he’s away, and Nice-kun will also review that footage.”\n&quot;You shouldn’t cut corners just because the organizers aren&#39;t watching, okay?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well then. I will announce the next theme.&quot;\n&quot;—&#39;The Demonstration of a Specialty.&#39;&quot;\n&quot;Instruments, props, costumes and the like have been placed on each floor of the venue so that you can respond to every theme however you see fit.&quot;\n&quot;The Thunderbolt staff has put their all into the preparations, and so there are rare items that you wouldn&#39;t even find in the shops in town.&quot;\n&quot;Try to hunt for what you seek.&quot;\n\n&quot;What abilities will you use to win [hearts] from the audience? I&#39;m looking forward to finding out, too~♪&quot;\n\n&#39;The Demonstration of a Specialty&#39;! The winds blow in my favor~ What shall we do?\nKnight-san. We belong to the same pair, so please make a request~♪\nI’ll fulfill any request, no matter how unreasonable~♪ Fire-breathing, tightrope walking, juggling, vocal imitation... please, anything you like~♪\nWhy do I have to make a request? Just show off a specialty that makes you look the best, right?\n\nFufu. There are so many choices, I&#39;m having a hard time deciding.\nI don&#39;t know what the audience’s tastes are yet either, so I think it&#39;s fine for you to decide, Knight-san~♪\n\n… Hah. Well, I&#39;m going to do a lot of model poses, so give me a hand, will you?\nYou&#39;re good at magic tricks, right? Like scattering flower petals and tinfoil and stuff... show me you can do that with ease.\n\nUnderstood~♪ Allow me to help you shine ☆\n\n… Hm. It’s a theme that favors Hibiki and Sena once again. It seems they’re in their element, the both of them are so lively.\n\nWhat about you, Taki?\nYou seem to be skillful, so I&#39;m sure you have one or two specialties, but... if you rush to start showing off your appeal, an accident might arise.\nTell me what you&#39;re planning to do. This is a strategy meeting.\n\nNyahaha~♪ You’re being just as cautious as I thought you would, huh, Hasumi-san~?\n\nWell, it’s the first day, so we gotta be on the same page. I’m gonna perform some martial arts.\n\nI see. So we’ll be showing off a dance performance.\nI don&#39;t know where the audience’s tastes are leaning towards yet. Let’s try anything to see.\n\nUltimately we’ll need to outclass the Hibiki-Sena pair, which will be a little tricky. But, this is a pair competition as well: I want to believe that there’s an opportunity to win there.\nTo do that, I need your cooperation, Taki.\n\nNyahaha. Leave it to me~♪ ‘Cuz I came here to win!\nI got no intention of getting outshone by whoever ends up being my opponent, y’know~? You gotta make sure to keep up with me so you don't get left behind, ‘kay, Hasumi-san~?\nChapter 6\n\nNow then, Hibiki and I will start with our &#39;Demonstration of a Speciality&#39;.\nHibiki, you too. Don’t just stand there, make sure you bring my performance out, okay?\n\nYes. Though from my perspective, it’s disappointing that the other pairs are so hesitant.\nWe stole the show in the demonstration a moment ago, so I suppose they want to delay their turn as far back as they can.\n\nI don’t think there’s any point to what they choose in the end, though. ‘Cause I&#39;m destined to win~♪\n\nHere we go. A rapid-fire of 100-model poses in a row…♪\n — ♪ (Strikes a pose)\n\n\n♪ ♪ ♪\n\n!?\n\nWhat the, what’s that…?\n\nThere’s two… Izumi-chins…!?\n\nNyahaha! What the hell’s happening~? That’s so interesting!\n\nIt looks something like a complete double of Sena-senpai… Is this Sena-senpai’s specialty?\n\n(Hold it, Hibiki!? Why are you disguised as me!?)\n\nHuh? There’s two of me?\n\nThese model poses are so beautiful, that it looks like I’ve multiplied into two, huh…?\nAhaha. As expected from the supermodel Sena Izumi~♪ The other me is beautiful too~♪\n(Even vocal imitation too?! — The hell, don&#39;t fool around with me!)\nHold it, Hibiki! I may have told you to make me stand out with your magic tricks, but I didn’t ask you to go that far!\n\nFufufu. Isn’t it good~♪ Thanks to that, everyone in the venue is paying attention to us~♪\nUrgh! Would you quit screwing around already!?\nYou&#39;re just making a fool out of me, aren’t you…! I&#39;m being serious about this!\n\nOh, please don&#39;t be so upset. From what I can tell from the screen, it seems that we’ve earned quite a lot of [hearts].\n\nI fulfilled your request and acted in a way that would genuinely earn us [hearts].\nHimegimi couldn’t participate in 4piece, so I also intend to pass, especially for his sake. Let&#39;s do our best together ♪\n\n……\n\nI figured those two would be trouble.\nThe favorable number they got is weighted lower a little after the conversion, but they&#39;re still attracting a lot of attention regardless.\n\nYeah. It’s to be expected from the members of two powerhouse units. They definitely hold their own in individual matches too.\n\nBut we're the ones who’re gonna win, right~? Next is mine and Hasumi's turn~♪\nYes. We can’t fall behind either. Taki, you said you’ll perform martial arts, right? I’ll be painting those martial arts with the sound of the shinobue.14\n\n\nNyahaha. I’m counting on you~, Hasumi-san~♪\nBut I don’t think I can get serious against Hasumi-san, so…\nAmagi-san, lemme borrow your body for a sec~!\n\n\n    The sound of a whoosh\n\n\n!\n\nTaki! What are you doing!?\nIt&#39;s inexcusable to behave so violently against our opposition. What if someone gets hurt!?\n\nI’m alright. He gave notice ahead of time, so there was plenty of time to brace for it.\n\nBut if I respond to your act, it won&#39;t be just your pair&#39;s appeal alone.\nIt would have been better if you displayed a dance performance to the accompaniment of Hasumi-senpai&#39;s flute, so why did you do that?\n\nHmm~? I never once said that dance performance was my specialty, did I~?\n\nMy one strong point is my combat skills! I&#39;ve gotten in a bout with Amagi-san before, so I thought he&#39;d be up for it~♪\n\nIs that right, Hiiro-chin?\n\nYes. He came out of nowhere during our club activities before. He launched a surprise attack on me and Buchou.\n\nA surprise attack…? Yet another disturbing thing happening right under my nose, huh?\n\nOh me, oh my. What a ruthless atmosphere everyone is giving~ Shall I settle the mood back down?\nI&#39;ll take on any gaze, any criticism, whatever one likes.\n\nWataru-chin and Izumi-chin’s performance is already over by now. We&#39;ll handle it some way or another.\n\nSettling down a rough situation is within the realm of the audition evaluation. I feel bad for Keito-chin, but we&#39;re going to take our turn.\n\nEh~?! Our turn isn't over yet, though~? You’re overstepping authority, ending it however you want! I don’t accept it~!\nStop it. It&#39;s a competition based around favorability, so what&#39;s the point of fighting to begin with?\nEven if you could demonstrate your martial arts skills, using savage techniques will only be a drawback.\nLook. We barely got any [hearts] for our appeal this time around.\n\nI was happy to get a chance to fight Amagi-san, though?\nWe’ve got stuff like bullfights and viper-mongoose cage matches in Okinawa, where I’m from~ It’d be exciting if idols fought too, right?\n\nOr what, I shouldn’t show off my specialty? Idols resorting to violence is a no-go... was it? 15\n\nYes. It’s against the law in Japan and the United States, regardless of being an idol. There&#39;s no cultural difference there.\nYou should be mindful of your surroundings and stay put for now, Taki.\n\nBut if you&#39;re showing off your specialties, that’s literally the time to be assertive about it. I don&#39;t get mainland culture at all, huh~?\nAmagi-san is well-built, and idols are the same kinda spectacle as bullfighting, right~?\nI’m doing it while knowing that my opponent won’t get hurt— yet it’s still no good?\n\n……\n\n(That Taki’s truly a loose cannon…!)\n(Can I really win and advance through the rounds of 4piece being paired with such a selfish, restless, brash guy like this…?)\n\n\n… Let’s get a fresh start, Hiiro-chin.\nMy specialty is… jumping real high! Let&#39;s all try jumping together ☆\nC’mere c’mere, Izumi-chin, you do it with us too! We’re former tennis club buddies, right?\n\nEven me? Why the hell…\nHah… Well, I&#39;m not a demon either, so… Fine, I guess I&#39;ll do it.\n\nBut first off, Nazunyan, are you even able to jump that high? This is the first time I’m hearing about it, though?\n\nWell, just leave it to me and see. You&#39;ll get it when we all jump together.\n\nEveryone! Let&#39;s jump with a &quot;Ready~set&quot;!\nI&#39;ll show you I can jump the highest!\nReady, set~!\n\n? Nazuna-senpai. It looked like I jumped higher, didn’t I?\n\nIt looked like Hibiki and I jumped higher than Nazunyan too… Is this really your specialty?\n\nI-It’s just a matter of height difference, that’s all! I sprung up further, right?!\n\nFufufu. My, you&#39;re deliberately using your &quot;specialty&quot; to unite everyone around you…!\nOn top of that, it seems you were considerably well-received by the audience too. That’s to be expected from talent like yours, little bunny ☆\n\nTh-That&#39;s not it at aw~wll!\n\nChapter 7\n\n     A few hours later. After the first day of 4piece’s evaluation ended.\n\n\n&quot;Did you enjoy the Twin Rooster Pagoda’s audition, everyone?&quot;\n“It must’ve been like feeling your way through a fog, appealing to an audience of a hundred.”\n&quot;Amorphous and silent, with only [hearts] to go off of to measure their reaction — I think you all did a great job in such an environment.&quot;\n\n&quot;In particular, the pair who made it to the top today – Hibiki-kun and Sena-kun – were spectacular.&quot;\n&quot;The audience was mesmerized by the classic, stately manner of Sena-kun&#39;s appeal, and amazed by the power of imagination that went into Hibiki-kun&#39;s appeal.&quot;\n&quot;Congratulations on such an impressive first place. That was a Nice appeal!&quot;\n\nThank you. But for us, it&#39;s only natural that we&#39;d be ranked at the top.\n\nYes. It&#39;s an honor to receive such praise, but it&#39;s still only the first day. If we grow too big of heads now, we’ll encounter trouble with the audition from the next day on.\n\n&quot;Mhmhm. A true professional attitude, alright. The audition has just begun, so who’s to say what will happen.&quot;\n&quot;Especially since the first day’s audience of a hundred were all likely to think favorably of you.&quot;\n\nLikely to think favorably of us...?\n\n“Yes. The hundred people gathered for this round were idol enthusiasts.”\n“Because everyone was favorable to you on opening day, we carried on without revealing their identities. However, from the next day onward, we’ll reveal the attributes of the hundred people gathered, and have them evaluate you.”\n“This will be announced when tomorrow&#39;s evaluation begins. Until then, return to the hotel and get some rest.”\n\nFufu. We got through the first match. Good work, Nazuna-senpai.\n\n……\n\nHey, Hiiro-chin. You don’t have to call me “Ni~chan”...\n\n? You don’t seem to be in very good spirits, what’s wrong, Nazuna-senpai?\nI wasn’t calling you “Ni~chan” from the start, so I’m not sure how to respond when you say I don’t need to…\nCould it be that you’re feeling hungry after the long day of the evaluation?\n\nNo, I’m not that fussy.\n\nBut today made me painfully aware how out of my depth I am. All my appeals today backfired, and it made me realize the extent of my incompetence.\nGoing to college is a relatively “normie” choice from society’s point of view, too. I don&#39;t have any specialties of my own that stand out either, so… to be honest, I’ve lost a lot of confidence.\nFrom tomorrow on, it&#39;s gonna get even tougher, right~? I don’t know if I can seriously become sufficient competition.\n\nPlease don&#39;t be so down, Nazuna-senpai.\nEven if you messed up with the theme, you still got a lot of [hearts].\nWhich means your existence alone is what makes you a desirable, highly-favored idol. Please have confidence in yourself.\n\nEh? &quot;My existence alone” is what makes me desirable...? How should I put this… isn&#39;t that a pretty big exaggeration?\n\nNo, it&#39;s not an exaggeration. I think Nazuna-senpai is amazing!\n\nI-I see~ Thanks, Hiiro-chin. It&#39;s a little embarrassing to hear you say that to my face, though…♪\nLike you said, it’s not good to be too self-deprecating. The number of [hearts] we got on opening day was about half of the whole audience.\nI guess we can just be grateful we weren&#39;t eliminated. It’d be pretty scary to get tossed into some weird pit-like trap like the ones you usually see on variety shows.\n\nYes, the pair in last place dropped to the floor below through the panel that opened under their feet. It seems amusing, I&#39;d like to get a turn being dropped once too.\n\nWhy?\n\nThere are cushions spread out underneath, so I thought it looked like some kind of attraction depending on how you look at it.\n\nO-Oh… I guess that might be true, depending on how you look at it.\n\nBut we&#39;re aiming to pass, so tomorrow, let&#39;s finish the day with a higher ranking.\n\nMhm. Naturally, I intend to do that.\nAfter all, Wataru-senpai, Sena-senpai, and Hasumi-senpai... For me, they’re all formidable opponents.\n\nWith Keito-chin though, I’m not all too sure how far he can keep up with that Taki kid.\nLook over there. It looks like Keito-chin is trying to get a feel of how to close the gap with Taki.\nEven Keito-chin might be feeling a little overwhelmed in front of the new generation, huh?\n\n……\n\n……\n\nYeah. They were in more of a slump than we were, so I wouldn’t say they have the best chemistry…?\n\nIt’s likely that they just couldn’t communicate properly since it was their first time meeting.\nWataru-chin and Izumi-chin dominated on opening day, but the affinity between their pair isn’t quite there, so it seems like the key to the audition is how each pair’s relationship changes over time.\n\nFufufu! It looks like you and I came out on top on opening day, Knight-san~♪\nI won’t allow this result to let my guard down, but what a splendid performance all the same!\n\n… That so?\nI’m going back to the hotel, so... See you tomorrow at the site.\n\nOh? Are we not going to have a debrief, Knight-san?\n\nThere’s nothing to really debrief about what happened today.\nIt should be fine as long as we keep the same energy tomorrow, right? If we make use of your techniques, we should be able to win [hearts] then too.\nBesides. With the way you act, it seems like you&#39;re here to make a fool out of the audition, and it&#39;s annoying.\n\nOh my! If that&#39;s what it seems to you, then I&#39;m dreadfully sorry!\n“Life is but a walking shadow, a pitiable actor... Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” 16\n—I can perform in a manner that seems serious, but it doesn’t suit the tastes of Knight-san, does it?\n\nThat’s exactly what I keep—!\n\nI’m sorry. I made you angry.\nI think you, too, are well aware that I am not the kind of person to get attached to things.\n\nWe do have to form pairs for the Twin Rooster Pagoda, but 4piece is an individual competition.\nWe hardly crossed paths, even in Yumenosaki, but happenstance has paired us up together.\nAs that’s the case, the best course of action is to play the role in a professional, businesslike manner—\n\nLet us both do the best we can.

Got it?\n\nAh, I see…. That’s some kind of tongue twister, huh. I thought for sure you were starting to spew off insults, Nazuna-senpai.\n\nWho would do something like that during an audition?! I said it before, it was a tongue twister?\nYou try saying one too, Hiiro-chin. Something like…… “The reason I bolstered this bundled bamboo balanced against the barrier was because the bundled bamboo balancing the barrier was what I wanted.”3\n\nThe reason I bolstered this bundled bamboo balanced against the barrier was because the bumbled bambboo...?\n\nLook, see, it’s trickier than you think, isn’t it?\n\nThat was definitely a far tougher tongue-twister to say.\n...

Is it really okay to get all these hearts even though we failed?\n\nThere’s times when it&#39;s better to fail.\nToday’s audience is an audience of “a hundred elderly people”...\nIf anything, failing is a cuter thing to do when you do it in a way that makes people want to lend you a hand.\n\nHm… I see.\nNazuna-senpai’s suggestion to do tongue-twisters really helped us out.

It&#39;s the audition I wanted after all.\nSo because of that, I asked you to say a more difficult tongue-twister, Hiiro-chin. Good thing you flubbed it.\n\nFufu.

Since they’re each trying to win hearts in their own way, they’ve lost all sense of unity as a pair.\n\nWataru-senpai too. It seems like it’s hard to get high valuations because of the judges. What he’s doing just feels too complicated, especially for the audience of seniors today.\nNazuna-senpai and Hasumi-senpai are keeping me and Ibuki in check. But Sena-senpai and Wataru-senpai don’t have that—\nI think what’s happening right now is coming from their lack of compatibility as a pair.\n\n\n&quot;— Ladies and gentlemen, how did you like the first appeal of the day?&quot;\n&quot;Et cetera, et cetera.

That imbalance came off as charming.&quot;\n&quot;The humble words from a moment ago nestled in very nicely with the audience of a hundred senior citizens too.&quot;\n&quot;Fulfilling the role you&#39;re expected to play— that&#39;s an idol’s job.&quot;\n\nHehehe, we did it~ Hasumi-san? Looks like we got a pretty good score, huh~?\nHmm. I&#39;m thankful for that, but it was more like a shop boy outside a temple gate chanting sutras — imitating something you’ve heard.\nI was just copying what I’ve seen.

Hasumi-san knows stuff I don't~♪\n“Next, the Amagi-Nito pair.”\n&quot;You thought the reason for your high valuation was how cute you looked, but to be frank, you’re mistaken.&quot;\n\nEh? Did we do something wrong…?\n\nI’m not sure. I think it&#39;s likely he’s just seeing things that only experts can see, though.\n\n&quot;That’s right. As Hiiro-kun says, I suspect the reason you were able to make off with so many hearts is because your voices were attractive.&quot;\n\nVoice…?\n\n&quot;Yes. You sang together yesterday as a comeback for your blunder on day two, didn’t you?&quot;\n&quot;Nazuna-kun&#39;s comfortable high notes with Hiiro-kun’s reassuring voice were well balanced, making it a pleasant singing tone for people of all ages.&quot;\n\nI-...

The hotel within the 4piece venue.

The view is nice from the bed by the window.\n\nBut it’ll be harder for you to escape me over there~ And even if you make an escape out the window, you’ll just hit the ground head first! Careful, ‘kay~?\n\n—That’s a dangerous thing to say. Are you always like this?\n\nWhat? Did I put you off with what I said?\n\nNo, I’m just interested.\nI thought perhaps you’re from a rough, wild 1 community or something, one that doesn’t hesitate to engage in violence.\n\nAfter all, you threw a blow on me during the Twin Rooster Pagoda audition, too. And the blows on Buchou and I — It felt as though they were completely indiscriminate.\nIf you are the type to engage in violence no matter the time or place, then I need to correct that mistake of yours.\nYou see, when I first came to the city, I myself had common sense relentlessly drilled into me by Aira.\n\nHm~? Aren’t you misunderstanding something? Neither America or Okinawa are rural places~?\n\nIf you had to get common sense hammered into you when you came here, then that means you’re the hillbilly2 here, right, Amagi-san~?\n\nMmn… I can’t let you talk to me like that.\nI don’t care if you insult me… But my friends and hometown bear no sins.\nCompared to what you think, my hometown is far and away a more advanced society.\n\nOhh? Is it even more advanced than America?\nI can’t tell what the actual truth is, but with the way your eyes are all serious, I’ll take your word for it~♪ \n\n… Hm. I thought for sure that you’d refuse it, but you&#39;re actually being honest, huh?\n\nNyahaha. There are so many worlds for each and every social etiquette and culture out there~ The absolute truth that you see isn’t necessarily the truth that I see.\nI’m not someone who can read the room, so I&#39;m glad Amagi-san told me his true feelings~♪\n\nCould it be that you provoked me… to get me to speak?\n\nO~hh? Amagi-san, you’re unexpectedly clever, huh?\nThat&#39;s right! Everyone seems to think I&#39;m a violent, dangerous idol, but I wouldn&#39;t use violence on a helpless child, you know~?\nHiding your true feelings, only ever putting up a good face... Those kinds of people who waste time doing all that are the ones I hate the most!\nThat&#39;s why I take tough measures now and again~♪\n\nA human’s true colors come out when they&#39;re on the brink of danger. Dontcha think~?\n\n… I don&#39;t really agree with your views, but I’ve come to understand your reasoning well enough.\nSo that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t lay your hands on anyone other than me. There was no one else in the Twin Rooster Pagoda who was well-versed with martial arts.\nYou made an example out of me to get a reaction from everyone around you.\n\nNyahaha~♪ You get it reaaal well, dontcha~?\n\nThanks to that, I learned more about Hasumi-san, too~\nUp ‘til now, I’ve only listened to AKATSUKI’s music, and I didn’t know anything about them as people at all! But he has an elegant feel that fits right in with a Japanese-style unit, huh~?\n\nMhm. He works as the dorm administrator for Seisoukan, so he’s the kind of person that’s strict with rules and regulations.\n\nBut you can get that with just a glance and a little conversation with him, can’t you?\nI can’t help but question your methods of observing people after all.\n\nThen, tell me! What kinda person is Amagi-san?\n\nWhat?\n\nI won&#39;t understand unless you teach me! You wanna correct all my mistakes, right? Then teach me~♪\n\nIt&#39;s hard to answer that so suddenly... On the contrary, what do you want to know about me?\n\nHmm, for example, that piece of cloth on your luggage! What the heck is that?\n\nThis is a good luck charm from Aira — My comrade.\nWhenever I worry during the audition, I bundle up the charm in one hand and make the sign of the cross with the other–\nAmen3\n\n… You know about a major American religion? That’s not really the time to say “Amen”, y’know~?\nAre you making fun of me? You’re a mean kinda guy, arentcha, Amagi-san~?\n\nI’m not lying. A person called Tatsumi-senpai taught it to me, his home is a church.\n\nAh. Maybe the religion Tatsumi-senpai practices has drastically changed here in Japan...!\n\nHm~m? Kinda sounds like a load of bull to me?\n\nBut I’ve taken a liking to you~♪\nYou’ve got something in common with me, so tell me what you found interesting about Japan~♪\n\nO-Okay. The culture of the city always astounds me too.\nIf you&#39;re okay with the extent of what I&#39;ve become acquainted with, I&#39;ll tell you about it as much as you want.\nWe don&#39;t even need to use something like violence, because we have a wonderful tool called words.\n\nChapter 9\n\n     At the same time. Nazuna and Izumi’s room\n\n\nI never thought I’d end up rooming with Izumi-chin…\n\nWhat? You don’t want to room with me or something?\n\nDon’t pounce on me over everything I say~ I just assumed we’d be sharing rooms with our partners from the Twin Rooster Pagoda, that’s all.\n\nThen again, if the pairs got to know each other better in the hotel, it&#39;d confuse the viewers.\n\nYeah. It looks like they don&#39;t have cameras in the hotel, so maybe they’re pretty orderly when it comes to these sorts of things.\nThey protect the privacy of the participants, while making full use of a large production staff to film everything during the audition.\nIt’s an audition organized by that goody-looking NiceP, so they must be following global standards, yeah?\n\nAhaha. Meanwhile, Yumenosaki and ES always feel like the night before a school festival. Well, that’s fun too though…♪\n\nBut, I don’t know if NiceP’s a good guy.\n\n? Is that distrust from the last SS?\n\nAh~... Yeah, all sorts of stuff happened, huh. I don’t feel any sorts of politics or schemes happening behind the scenes of 4piece, though.\nIf I had to say it, it’s NiceP himself I’m talking about.\n\nI’d prefer for you to keep this between us, but… The truth is, NiceP is something of a Ra*bits fan. Look at the name written on this fan letter.\n\n“Arneb”? This name’s…?\n\nYeah. Nice Arneb Thunder. NiceP’s stage name.\nHe came to a Ra*bits live performance and a handshake event, too.\n\nAt first I thought it might just be someone who looks like him — but when he was pretty well aware of my speech impediment during the audition, I became more convinced it really was him.\nIt seems that &quot;Arneb&quot; means &quot;hare&quot; in a foreign language, so maybe that&#39;s how he found out about us...\n\nThe person in charge of the show is a fan of Ra*bits!? That&#39;s not fair!\n\nCalm down, Izumi-chin.\nEven in the fan letter, he wrote, &quot;Your recent live was Nice ☆ But I’ll be strict with my judging in the audition&quot;, so I don&#39;t think he plans to show favoritism.\n\nThere&#39;s no guarantee that NiceP won&#39;t act on selfish desires during the audition, though.\n\nYeah. So I’ll keep a careful eye out too.\nBut. Regardless of the audition, if he’s genuinely evaluating us, I couldn&#39;t be happier.\n\nIf I end up passing, I want you to judge it for yourself — Whether or not the evaluation criteria was wrong.\nI want you to be a witness, Izumi-chin.\n\nHmm…?\nThere&#39;s no benefit to Nazunyan telling me about NiceP. That alone just shows you’re putting trust in me; am I right to think that?\n\nYeah. I wanna be seen without bias too. Izumi-chin and NiceP both.\n\nHah~... Finally, what a weight off my shoulders...!\nIt looked like I was the only one who knew about the other side of NiceP, so it was a bit of a burden~ I&#39;m so glad I could tell Izumi-chin, y’know?\n\nAh~ What a relief! I'm in the same room as Izumi-chin~♪ It’s a blessing to have friends~♪\n\nWe’re former tennis club buddies, after all. Thank you~♪ \n\nI&#39;m here to pass the audition, so don&#39;t complain if I end up needing to toss that camaraderie away for the sake of the evaluation, ‘kay?\nWell, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m rooming with you too, Nazunyan. If I was rooming with Hibiki, I doubt I’d be able to relax nearly as much.\nI wonder what Hibiki and Hasumi could possibly be talking about in their room.\n\nOh? So those two were sharing the same room...\nThat&#39;s true, I do wonder what Keito-chin and Wataru-chin could be talking about~ Although, I feel like there were plenty of times they became opponents when we were at Yumenosaki.\n\nBut maybe having to room together this time will bring them together closer than they expected~♪\n\nI dunno about that... If it was that easy to get along with people, I don&#39;t think there’d be any wars in the world.\n\n\n… A– Achoo!\n\nOh. Is that a cold I hear, Keito-kun?\n\nHow lamentable of my lifelong rival…! Where in the world is the Keito-kun who faced off against me!\n\nYou’re overexaggerating. I’m sure someone’s just talking about me behind my back.4\n\nHmm. Is that right? If so, I’m relieved.\nI thought I’d make you something to warm you up if you had a cold, but that was a needless fear, hm?\n\nYes. … Actually, don&#39;t use your strands of hair to lift the pot. It&#39;s terrifying.\n\nEh~? Don&#39;t be so cold. One’s life needs to have wonder in it, doesn’t it?\n\nWe’re in the middle of an audition, but you’re as detached from the world as always.\nI heard the second day is even more difficult. If you want to pass, you should rest early too.\n\nYes. I too am aiming to pass! I take pride in being the best entertainer after all ☆\nSo tonight I&#39;ll go to bed a little earlier than usual. I&#39;ll heed your advice, mm?\n\n… I suppose it really is better to show that you’re taking it seriously when it comes to an audition~\nI always intend to be serious, but it seems no one trusts that about me at all.\n\n? What? That&#39;s odd. I wasn’t expecting you to be hesitant.\n\nAttitudes aren’t something you should force, but for the showdown of Twin Rooster Pagoda, being seen as favorable means everything.\nWhatever you believe, that alone is a fact, at least. If you&#39;re worried about it, do as you see fit, whether it be performance or other.\nMake sure not to catch a cold, either. Hibiki.\n\nYes. I&#39;ll be sure to do that.\nAfter all, if poor health forces me to withdraw from a grand event such as 4piece, Himegimi will be sad to see it.\n\nChapter 10\n\n     At the same time. Seisoukan common room.\n\n\nTattsun-senpai! Hurry up, hurry uuup~!\nThe 4piece broadcast! It’s already startiiing!\n\nIt’s dangerous to rush over like that, you know, Aira-san?\nThe 4piece broadcast is available for recording and archived streaming, so let’s first set our things down and settle down.\n\nOh, the TV in the common room… It seems that people are already here, holding a watch party. Shall we join in?\n\n\nah. tatsumi~♪ are you here to watch the [audition] as well?\n\nIndeed. Hiiro-san and Mayoi-san of our ALKALOID are participating, so we were hoping to support them.\n\nIf that’s the case, you’re a lil’ late. The second venue, the Gourmet District5, just ended.\nRight now, it’s in the middle of broadcastin’ the third venue that Hiiro-kun’s appearin’ in, the Twin Rooster Pagoda.\n\nNo waayy~... I wanted to see Mayo-san’s gallant figure, too!\n\nMayoi-dono did his best, as well. He struggled and worked really hard within such a packed crowd~♪\n\n\nAre we sure about that…? It looked like there was a huge problem going on for him, though - including for Morisawa-senpai…6\n\nEh? What’s that mean, I’m sooo curious…!\n\n\nShiratori, all of you. Could you be a little more quiet?\nHasumi-dono is appearing on the Twin Rooster Pagoda as well. If it gets too noisy, I won’t be able to concentrate.\nBesides, Amagi is participating in the Twin Rooster Pagoda too. Isn’t it the duty of comrades to lend their support?\n\nYou think so too, don’t you, Kiryu-dono?\n\n\nYup. We all took the time t’get in front of the TV, so I think we’d better watch it properly.\nBut, watch parties are s’pposed t’get noisy.\nI came along ‘cuz ya said ya had to watch it at the screening, Kanzaki. Give ‘em a lil’ break for the noise, will ya?\n\nHmn… Kiryu-dono is right, I may have been a little too on edge.\n\nYou should all see how everything is set up in the Twin Rooster Pagoda. It seems that some sort of “taggu”-team battle is taking place in it.\n\nTag-team battle…! Wow, I heard that 4piece was an individual competition, but there are special rules like that too, huh~? ♪\n\nIndeed. Had I known it was a “taggu”-team battle, I would have loved to participate…!\nI didn’t want to compete against Hasumi-dono, so I firmly refused to participate… but looking at how that so-called “Taki” has been behaving, I&#39;m concerned about Hasumi-dono...!\n\nHaha, even if ya joined in, it doesn’t mean y’woulda become Danna’s7 partner like Taki did.\n\nTaki…? I’m not familiar with that name.\n\nYeah, so. Apparently, he’s an idol that got scouted by NiceP, ‘n is temporarily part of ES.\nI think that kinda unconventional guy is interesting, but I wonder what Hasumi-no-danna thinks about it...♪\n\nKiryu-dono is such an incredibly open-minded man... I&#39;m so worried about Hasumi-dono that I can&#39;t maintain my composure when I look at Taki!\n\nIs he that dangerous of a participant? That Taki idol...?\n\n\nYeah, you could say that. Taki-kun showed up in front of me and Hiiro-kun outta nowhere and exchanged blows with us.\nHe made good use of surprise attacks and assault tactics, so I couldn&#39;t gauge his exact strength… But if we took him on in a proper fight, he’d have been a pretty tough force who could wear us down just as much as we could to him.\n\nAssault!? I make a point to try not to think about it, but the karate club really does way more than just club activities, doesn’t it!?\n\nAhaha. It’s not that noteworthy, we’re more like an imitation of a karate master.\nCompared to people who are actually serious and focused around martial arts, we still have a long way to go.\n\nEh...? It doesn&#39;t sound like that to me, though…?\n\nWell, in the eyes of someone who’s got no experience in it, there&#39;s no difference between a black belt and a master, I bet.\nAnyways, teamin’ up with a troublemaker ain’t always a bad thing. If anything, it looks to me that Danna’s charm really comes out when he’s bein’ put in front of Taki~♪\nReminds me of when we were students. It’s like I’m lookin’ at the Danna when the academy was in shambles, where he was actin’ all tough.\n\nMmm… It’s certainly true that Hasumi-dono seems to be getting a considerable amount of “su-ku-reen-taimu” because of that scoundrel, but…\nI haven’t recognized Taki quite yet.\n\nI will see what kind of fate the upcoming audition has in store for Hasumi-dono and Taki from here on out, until the very end!8\n\nChapter 11\n\n“Nice morning, isn&#39;t it everyone!”\n“It’s the second day of the Twin Rooster Pagoda, so let’s jump right back into the evaluation again. Did you all sleep well last night?”\n\n… Hey, Keito-chin. I wonder why that guy puts “Nice” in front of stuff all the time. Is that his character trademark or something?\n\nDon’t ask me.\n\n“Oh? Are you getting tired of the word “Nice”?”\n“If I said something ceremonious like &#39;today is an auspicious day,&#39; I thought you’d all tense up, so I tried to lighten the mood with humor.”\n“If you can’t concentrate on the competition, I’ll retract it ♪”\n\nAh, he heard that!? Sorry!\nI wasn’t trying to pick on your comments, NiceP, I was just wondering.\n\n“Fufufu. It’s alright, don’t be embarrassed.”\n“Even if I didn’t say “nice”, this world is filled to the brink with “nice” things…☆”\n“At any rate, it’s the second day of evaluations, so the composition of the audience will now be revealed.”\n“Yesterday, the audience was composed of “a hundred idol enthusiasts”, so they were relatively favorable to you all. However, this might not be the case going forward—”\n“The audience for the second day will be composed of… “music enthusiasts” !”\n“You must all gain the favor of one hundred music enthusiasts!”\n“The first theme you will attempt is “freedom” —”\n“You can use any means necessary, so I expect a great fight from you all…♪”\n\n\nHmm. Seems we’ve got a bit of a challenge up ahead for us...♪\nThe tougher the opponent, the easier it’ll be for us to get a lead. It’s a good time to make bank on some competition points. Well, Hibiki?\n\nIndeed. Leave it to me, Knight-san.\nBefore anything else, let&#39;s take a look at the instruments Twin Rooster Pagoda has to offer.\nI can play all sorts of instruments, so— I’ll do my best to accomodate Knight-san’s performance ♪\n\n\n(Hm. Hibiki and Sena don’t seem to be going for the appeal right away.)\n(We’re lucky they went to check the selection of instruments first. If Hibiki, a versatile performer, had taken the lead, the rest of us who follow would come off as inferior, left in the dust.)\n\n(So the second day’s audience is comprised of “ a hundred music enthusiasts”, huh—)\n(In short, it means today’s evaluation is reliant on satisfying the audience through sound.)\n\n(Of course, the matter at hand when it comes to the evaluations of Twin Rooster Pagoda is receiving hearts, so it doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be particular about the type of music.)\n(Just like you can’t let an audience who came to see your live performance go home without playing at least one song, we have to make sure these music enthusiasts get to hear something, too.)\n(The question is how and what we’ll perform—)\n(Seeing that this is a competition for pairs, it’d be better to have two people perform one song together rather than each of us perform our own individually.)\n\nTaki. There’s a few things I’d like to ask you, but—9\n\n\nHasumi-san!

He’s already started performing…!\n\n(The musical performance sounds free and unconventional, but somehow it lingers in my ears…)\n\nIt couldn’t be… you’re playing… “A Thousand Blossoms, the Night of Crimson Moon”, aren’t you?\nIt&#39;s a largely different take on the original song, so I didn&#39;t recognize it immediately, but there&#39;s no doubt about it. Why are you able to play this song?\n\nI told you, didn’t I~ That I’m gonna play an AKATSUKI song, yeah?\nNone of the other pairs have started performing yet, y’know~? This is a golden opportunity, so why don&#39;t you play along with me, Hasumi-san? ♪\nLook, look! That’s a shamisen13 over there, right? Jam sesh with me~♪\n\nYou…! Have you no consideration for where I stand…!\n\nFine. I’ll just play the shamisen, then…!\n\n♪~♪~♪\n(... Hmph. Taki’s proclivity to do things as he pleases is unmanageable.)\n(He just starts appealing without thinking… Doesn’t he get that there’s “music enthusiasts” of all kinds out there?)\n\n(Still… This is the first time I’ve heard “A Thousand Blossoms, the Night of Crimson Moon” sound like this.)\n(The song does use the electric guitar, but the unique way Taki plays it makes it sound innovative.)\n(The shamisen part completes the arrangement perfectly, so it must’ve taken some careful thought and practice by that Taki guy.)\n\n(Taki, it’s just like Eichi predicted. You seem to be someone who’ll rock the boat of this competition...♪)\n\n“… Oh ho. The blending of Western and Japanese influence in the Hasumi-kun-Taki-kun pair’s performance makes it quite interesting.”\n“As it’s only the beginning of the second day, the judges seem like they’re being conservative with the hearts they’re giving out.”\n&quot;Still, even taking that into account, these two managed to gain a considerable number of hearts.&quot;\n&quot;Hasumi’s quick response to Taki&#39;s improvisation was a Nice counter!&quot;\n\nFufufu. As expected of my eternal rival. He can handle anything unexpected purely off the experience he’s gained to adapt as needed.\nThat being said, I don’t intend to lose either...♪\n\nWhy are you gathering up so many instruments? Are you planning on monopolizing them and not letting other pairs use them?\nNot at all. I’ll be helping myself and using all of these instruments.\nHah? What are you saying? What’s that supposed to mean?\nI meant exactly what I said.\nBy the way, do you have experience playing musical instruments in instrumental performance, Knight-san?\nEh? Me? No, I only took the lessons they had at school...\nUnderstood! Well, would you please play this melodica then?\nHah? Why do I have to play as well? Can&#39;t I just compete with my singing?\n\nFufu. There was a wonderful performance just a moment ago, so just singing will pale in comparison to it..\nIf we’re competing as a pair, I thought it would be best to show my versatility since I&#39;m not as confident in my singing abilities as Knight-san is about his.\nNaturally, I don’t intend on humiliating you. I&#39;ll cover for you by playing my instruments at the same time, so please play fully and thoroughly to your heart&#39;s content, Knight-san ♪\n~...♪\n\nHey, you can’t just move on from conversations as you pleaaaase!!\n~Tch! A melodica10 for me? What the hell am I supposed to do with this!\n\n~...♪ Now, let’s go together ♪\n♪~♪~♪\nDon’t reply between breaths!\nUgh, give me a break... You need me to just play this right-- FINE!\n♪~!\n\n“Hm. It seems the Hibiki-kun-Sena-kun pair are playing instruments as well.”\n&quot;And on top of that, Hibiki-kun’s playing several instruments at the same time.&quot;\n&quot;Bagpipe and accordion, harmonica and cymbals... It&#39;s like he&#39;s a cheerful one-man orchestra. Now that’s Nice!&quot;\n&quot;In this case, it seems it’ll be a ruthless competition between the pairs to take the hundred music enthusiasts head on…...♪&quot;\n(Now, if I had to state just one concern... This is a pair competition as well—)\n(If it continues on like this, Sena-kun may be overlooked while Hibiki-kun takes the entirety of the audience’s attention.)\n\nChapter 12\n\nThat was an incredible performance. That Wataru-chin…\n\nYeah. Playing so many instruments with ease. It was almost divine, beyond human skill.\nOn top of that, Wataru-senpai may have overshadowed it, but I feel like Hasumi-senpai’s pair’s performance seemed really good too.\nI think we’ve fallen a bit behind those two pairs.\nWhat should we do, Nazuna-senpai? What should we do to satisfy “music enthusiasts”?\n\nMn…~ I’m at a loss. I figured we could just get by singing each of our signature songs, but it doesn&#39;t look like it’s gonna be that easy.\nKeito-chin’s pair and Wataru-chin’s pair both did two-man performances, so that set the standard.\nLooks like we’ll have to put on a joint performance too.\nWhat instruments can you play, Hiiro-chin?\nIf neither of us are that good with playing instruments, let’s just sing together.\n\n\nHm. I can’t really play modernistic11 instruments like Ibuki, but if something traditional is fine, I’ve got a little experience playing it.\nMe playing an instrument, Nazuna-senpai singing along… How does that sound?\n\nWay to go, Hiiro-chin! Well then, I’ll leave the instrumentation to you!\nYou said traditional instruments— something like a koto12 or a shamisen or a taiko drum, right?\nI’ll sing in a way that matches the accompaniment, feel free to just focus on playing ♪\n\nThat’d be a big help. It’s hard to play and sing at the same time.\nNow then, can you sing both the high and low parts at the same time?\n\nHuh?\nWaitwait, hitting high and low parts at the same time by myself… I’ve only got one set of vocal cords, y’know!?\n\nIt’s alright. I think Nazuna-senpai can get the hang of it right away ♪\nI’m going to go grab the mazura daijouhari14 so please wait here!\n\nMazu… eh? What’s that? Is that an instrument?\n\nTo play the mazura daijouhari, you pluck the strings with a needle.\nYou might not know it, Nazuna-senpai, but it’s a traditional instrument of my hometown. Think of it like a stringed instrument.\n\nWhat kinda instrument is that!? They’ve actually got one at the venue!?\n\nMhm. I see a mazura daijouhari over there.\nIf there wasn’t one, I was still planning to make use of one of the instruments here, but it looks like it&#39;s our lucky day, huh.\n\n???\nUuu~! I don’t get it at awwwll! This whole thing is way out there!16\nI-I’ll do my best for now, but if it’s no good, we’ll follow the original plan and sing together. Okay?\n\nThanks for letting me play an instrument from my hometown.\nWell then, on my cue, please start singing. 3, 2, 1…\n♪~♪~♪\n\n♪...!? ♪...?\n(It’s too hard! Or should I say, I’m not meshing with the sound of the instrument at all!)\n(What on earth is that instrument? The fluctuations of the sound are way too sensitive, it doesn&#39;t mesh with the human voice!?)\n(Ah~ That’s why you said I had to hit both low and high sounds. I should hum the low notes to stay in tune, while singing the main melody in a high voice, then!?)\n(... Is it even possible for me to do that!? That’s way too unreasonable of a demand!)\nHiiro-chin, timeout! Stop playing for a sec!\nIt doesn’t feel like my singing and the sound of the instrument are matching up!\n\nRight! That didn’t work at all, huh?\nIf it’s like this, I&#39;ll give up on playing an instrument and start singing along with Nazuna-senpai!\n♪~♪~♪\n♪~♪~♪\n(... Hm. It seems like Amagi-kun and Nito-kun have quit their performance and switched to singing together.)\n(They didn’t announce the end of the appeal and kept going, so it’s not like they’re overstepping the rules. I wonder what the audience thinks about this.)\n(The answer solely lies on the decision the audience comes to together. That’ll remain to be seen—)\n\n(Sigh) We didn’t get any hearts at all.\nI’m sorry, Hiiro-chin. I should’ve taken charge and made the call on whether we went with it or not.\nI made the mistake of thinking I could cover just about anything for the sake of making use of Hiiro-chin’s individuality.\nIt’s frustrating, but I’m not versatile like Wataru-chin.\n\n\nNo. I&#39;m the one who should apologize. I panicked because everyone around us was playing instruments, and I made you overextend yourself.\nBesides, you agreed with what I said I wanted to do.\nI didn’t know what I was doing, but you didn’t shut me down. You just gave me the opportunity to use my customs for the appeal instead.\nYou’re the one taking initiative for us, and yet I took you for granted Nazuna-senpai...\nI feel that it’s my fault.\n\nHiiro-chin…\n… No, if we keep feeling down about it, we’ll end up stuck in a rut. Each of us have reflected on our actions, so let&#39;s switch gears!\nThe other pairs have finished their demonstrations, and it looks like the next theme will be announced too, right~?\n\n… Right. Let’s let our failures motivate us and move forward.\nI truly believe we’ll reach the audience next time— definitely. Nothing will ever start if we’re too afraid to try.\n\nChapter 13\n\n♪~♪~♪\n♪~♪~♪\nThank you very much for your kind and courteous attention.\nAnd that was the joint appeal from the Sena-Hibiki pair!\n\nSo, that brings our total hearts for the day to… 86, huh?\n\nIf you consider that there’s not a single person who can please everyone, I’d say we did well.\nThe audience wasn’t giving hearts up easy this time, but we gradually won them over. What a relief, hm ♪\n\n“Now then, thus concludes the appeals for today.”\n“Let’s announce how many hearts were earned.”\n“The top-scoring team of the second day is… the same as the first! The Hibiki-kun-Sena-kun pair!”\n\n...\n\n...\n\n“To win over the favor of the music enthusiasts, not only did you show off your singing and performance skills...”\n“You did all sorts of things to compliment the performance, like introducing the songs you like with personal anecdotes.”\n“That was likely the reason for your victory.”\n“Next is the Taki-kun-Hasumi-pair, hm? Congratulations.”\n“Taki-kun was daring, but moreover, Hasumi-kun, who was caught up in his whirlwind…”\n“The two of you seem to have become an interesting combination befitting a variety show. Together, you brought out each other’s strengths, hm?”\n\nI see. Nassan keeps a keen eye on things, huh~?\nLooks like me and Hasumi-san are unexpectedly good together~♪\n\nTry being the one who has to cover for you. I felt like I was clinging on for dear life, hear me?\n\n“Heheh. Looks like you’re gradually syncing up better. If you show that that virtue will serve you well in the coming days, I’ll be glad for it.”\n“And finally, the Nito-kun-Amagi-kun pair, who narrowly avoided last place.”\n\n...\n\n...\n\n&quot;If you had showcased your individual strengths, you might’ve placed higher. Your individual abilities are more than enough to be idols.&quot;\n&quot;I’m sure you two are aware of the problem: you weren’t in sync. That’s what led to your low ranking as the booby-prize winners.&quot;\n&quot;Tomorrow, a new audience of a hundred will be judging you, things might change tomorrow.&quot;\n“Everyone. I want you to take what you’ve gotten from today and put it to use while making your adjustments and show up tomorrow ready to face the evaluation ♪”\n\n(Exhale) Feels like we were hanging by a thread there~ Honestly, I thought we’d get eliminated on the spot.\n\nYeah, I thought the same.\nOur compatibility with the judges was a fatal blow at the evaluation today. I feel like everything we did backfired.\n\nWe failed to get off to a good start, they were pretty harsh on us...\n\nI’m really, truly sorry, Nazuna-senpai.\n\nNo. I’m the one who should be sorry.\nYou didn’t do anything wrong Hiiro-chin, our rhythm was just a little mismatched from each other…\nWe kept spinning our wheels and holding back from each other.\nBut today’s today. Tomorrow’s tomorrow.\nLet’s aim for a better ranking tomorrow. If it’s us, we can definitely do it…!\n… That’s right. Hiiro-chin. I have a proposal. Could you listen for a sec?\n\nA proposal?\n\nYeah. After we’re done here, why don’t we hang out at the hotel together?\nWe’re in different hotel rooms, right~? That means we don’t have much time to understand each other. I feel like there’s still a lot to talk about.\nThe Izumi-chin-Wataru-chin pair have been running away with the lead since yesterday. If things keep up like this, we won’t be able to beat them. I want to try everything we can.\n\nDefinitely. There’s no specific rules about how you spend your time at the hotel, so that might be a good idea.\nI&#39;d like to hang out with you more too, Nazuna-senpai. Evaluation or not, it&#39;s good to deepen your friendships with people.\nI’ll let Ibuki know I’ll be getting back late— he’s who I’m rooming with.\n\nRight. Me too… Well, that’s what I’d like to say, but I&#39;m not sure if I should ‘cause Izumi-chin’s my roommate.\nIf he finds out and starts cooperating with Wataru-chin, it&#39;ll be a little out of our hands, right? It’s probably best to keep it a secret from them.\n\nOooh~? A secret training session? Sounds fun~\nMn… Ibuki-chin, you heard us?\nGuess it saves me the trouble of explaining, then. Hiiro-chin’s gonna take a while to get back to the room to do stuff for the evaluation. Feel free to do whatever an Ibuki-chin does, Ibuki-chin.\n\nSo that’s how it is, hmmm? The two of you are just doing what you want, huh~? I wonder if I should lend a hand to the enemy?\n… Kidding~ I don’t have the right to stop Amagi-san anyways~\nI’ve got my sights set on taking down the top duo too, so I want in on that strategy meeting.\nMe and Hasumi-san’ll join up too~♪\n\nYou too…?\nWait, no, you&#39;re a formidable opponent but we’re already too far in to go back.\nEven if we keep fighting on our own, we can’t stop Izumi-chin and Wataru-chin&#39;s momentum. Let&#39;s work together, the four of us.\n\nRight. I support what Nazuna-senpai thinks about it.\nLet’s learn more about each other— what we can do and what we can’t— as we fight side by side.\n\nChapter 14\n\n     That night.\n\n\nHasumi-san, c’mere c’mere! Everyone&#39;s gathered on the sofa over there~♪\n\nDon&#39;t be in such a hurry, Taki.\nWhat you said is certainly true, communication is necessary to take down the Sena-Hibiki pair.\nBut running in the hotel will bother the other guests— and even if there were no one else around, you could slip on the floor.\n\nNyahaha. That’s so you, huh Hasumi-san~?\n\nWith your physical ability, you probably wouldn&#39;t get hurt running a bit, though.\nWhat you can do and what others can do are different. You learned that in the Twin Rooster Pagoda too, didn’t you?\n\nThat’s right~ That’s why I find Hasumi-san real interesting too, y’know~?\nHe’s got things I don’t, so I enjoy just listening to him~\nThe same goes for you and your “Nazuna-senpai”, right Amagi-san?\n\nYeah. The evaluations for the Twin Rooster Pagoda venue — like the two roosters that decorate the pagoda show, you can discover a lot of different things by bringing two personalities together.\nAs someone who ordinarily works in a four-person unit, I’ve never really been cognizant of that.\n\nAhaha. It looks like Ibuki-chin and Hiiro-chin have opened up to each other before we knew it ♪\nThey stayed in the same room together yesterday, so maybe you were able to get to know each other?\n\nI don’t know about that. I doubt we understand each other, but…\nAt the very least, I get that he’s someone I can communicate with. I’ve decided you don’t have to be too on-guard with him.\nNaturally, you need to keep an eye out for surprise attacks though.\n\nWhat a cruel thing to say, Amagi-san~? Don’t make it sound like I go around ambushing people at random~\nAhaha. You really have gotten used to each other! It’s just like I thought, communication outside the evaluation window seems important ♪\n\nIt might be as Nito said. During the evaluation, you get so caught up worrying about the theme or the audience that you don’t consider your partner.\nTaki and I had both just met, so we were still feeling our way around each other.\n\nEven so, I thought you and Ibuki played in perfect sync, though!\nI heard that Ibuki had known about AKATSUKI before this, but he seemed to know quite a lot about it back there. Did you know of them while you were in America?\n\nAh. I was wondering about that too.\nAKATSUKI is a Japanese-style unit, but how is it being received by foreign audiences?\nCould it be that AKATSUKI has come into fashion overseas…?\n\nNyahaha~ It’s not like that at all~\nIt might be popular in places I don’t know of, but I haven’t heard much about it~?\nI’m from Okinawa, so I just happened to hear AKATSUKI’s music~15\n\n\nIt&#39;s disappointing when you say it so directly like that...\nBut if you think about it pragmatically, I suppose that makes sense. It’s wishful thinking to assume that idols who are mainly active in Japan would have equal valuation in America and the like, isn’t it?\n\nJust like Japan and its idols, America has its own idols in America.\nBut every once in a while, idols who transcend borders will turn up, so you can’t generalize from that alone.\nThough, it’s rare for Japanese idols who are already doing well at home to aim abroad~\n\nOut of everyone participating in this round, Izumi-chin seems to be the one who’s like that. He conducts idol activities in both Florence and Japan, so he&#39;s actively working towards working internationally.\n\nEven so, hasn’t MELLOW DEAR US been pretty popular recently?\n\nMELLOW DEAR US…?\n\nIt’s an overseas unit that Nassan is producing! I feel like Nassan said that there was a Japanese member or something~\n\nNow that you mention it, I feel like that’s something I&#39;ve heard from Aira.\nThese days they’ve been coming to Japan and stuff, and it’s becoming a hot topic among a fraction of the fans… or something?\n\nYes. I heard from Sakuma that some idols had their work canceled because of that as well.\n\nIf anything, it’s an opportunity.\nIf you’re selected by NiceP, you’ll get more opportunities than you have now. You’ll be able to work abroad, and if you perform well, you’ll be able to get more work wherever you live.\nBecoming a top idol overnight won’t just be a dream.\n\nRight. For me, it seems like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to broaden the scope of your activities.\n\nThe problem is that it’s not like the relationship between the Taki-Hasumi pair can be built in a day.\nThe same goes for us, we see each other at the dorms every once in a while and work together, but — I&#39;m not sure if I can say we understand each other on a deeper level.\nHmn~... How can I come to understand Hiiro-chin better?\n\nRight… I don’t know yet either, but...\nI think there was a hint in the conversation Hasumi-senpai and Ibuki were having.\nFor instance, what if I listened to a Ra*bits song and Nazuna-senpai listened to one from ALKALOID?\nThe songs of our units, in other words, represent our thoughts and feelings.\nJust like how Ibuki learned about Hasumi-senpai through an AKATSUKI song, I feel like we can deepen our understanding of each other through each other’s songs.\nOur phones and information devices have been confiscated, but I’m pretty sure there were some audio setups in the Twin Rooster Pagoda we could use for self-appeals.\nHow about it, Nazuna-senpai? If that’s wrong, please feel free to say so.\n\nTry listening to each other’s… songs…?\nYeah, that might be a good way to make use of the time while the other pairs are doing their appeals.\nLet’s give it a try, Hiiro-chin\n\nHeheh. It looks like the two of you have started to understand how to communicate right away.\nWe’d like to keep talking too, but… it looks like dinner’s just about ready.\nHow about we continue our conversation at the restaurant? Sharing a meal should be the perfect way to open up and relax, after all.\n\nThat sounds great! I’m in~♪\nThis restaurant&#39;s buffet has dishes from my hometown too. I wanna eat all sortsa stuff while we talk~♪\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Hiiro says 野性的な (yasei-tekina) here, which essentially means &quot;wild&quot; in the sense of to rely on ones wild or bare instincts.↑ Ibuki uses 田舎者 (inaka-mono) here, which roughly means &quot;someone from the country&quot; or a &quot;countryperson&quot;. It's often used in a derogatory manner, (often to describe someone unruly or unsophisticated), hence why Hiiro reacts indignantly. I translated this as &quot;hillbilly&quot; to get across that it's an insult.↑ Said in English.↑ It's a common Japanese superstition that when you sneeze, someone is talking about you or gossiping behind your back.↑ The second part of 4piece, VS Gourmet, which Chiaki and Mayoi were a part of.↑ The difficulties Mayoi and Chiaki ran into are from Praise of Delicious Flavors, Chapter 7↑ Kuro often refers to Keito as 旦那 (danna, lit. master ), or &quot;boss&quot;.

This abridged version has been posted early in light of Ibuki's debut. When the full story is complete, this page will be replaced.\n\nInfluence 6\nFourth Day of the Twin Rooster Pagoda, Audience: 100 Foreign Tourists; Theme: An Appeal in Place of a Greeting\nThe participants must appeal to a hundred tourists from abroad. Wataru and Izumi choose to incorporate many different foreign languages in their appeal.\n\nGrazie mille!! 3\nPhew, we did some real good work.\n\nNow let’s see. We got……— 62 hearts!?\nTh-This has to be a mistake…! My beautiful looks with a score as low as this…!\n\nI don&#39;t think the evaluation is based on beauty alone. Though, it seems that today&#39;s audience has a different perspective than the ones before.\nWere they looking for something different than what we’ve prepared for them?\n\n\nNyahaha! They’re tourists, so duh~?\nIf you’re playing to the overseas crowd, you should find a way to make stuff unique to this country easy to understand~\nAlso, getting a shoddy greeting in a foreign language is just gonna be seen as shoddy communication~♪\n\nHah? Are you bad-mouthing your senior? You’re cocky through and through.\n\nBut I don&#39;t think the strategy I was talking about was wrong?  If you want proof, just take a look at Hasumi-san&#39;s appeal.\n\nHasumi’s…?\n\n\n“Everyone. Now, I will be demonstrating one of my specialties: kyudo.”\n“Taki. If it looks like any words and phrases are confusing the audience, could you help explain it so they can understand?”\n\n“Nyahaha! Leave it to me!”\n\n“This is a yumi, or a Japanese bow. I suppose it’s surprising how much longer it is than a Western-style bow, isn’t it?. Using this, you shoot a distant target by clearing your mind of every thought.”\n“This – kyudo –  is one of Japan’s military arts.”\n“Now then, watch closely.”\n\n“Hah!”\n\nWhat splendid ability, Keito-kun. Right on the mark on the first try......♪\n\nWhew, that’s Hasumi-san alright~♪”\n\n“We’re not done just yet. Here’s a second arrow– a third arrow too–”\n\nUwah~ Keito-chin’s so proficient.\nWe should use that as reference for our appeal when the time comes, but let’s see what we should demonstrate to begin with.\n\nIf that’s the case, I could try giving archery a shot too.\n\nNazuna and Hiiro proceed to do hunting archery, with Nazuna throwing balls as moving targets for Hiiro to shoot down.\nHm… Even though they based their decision on what we’d done, it’s still an impressive skill.\n\nLooks like I totally gave the two of them a hint, huh~?\nIt coulda been our chance to get a lead, but I tend to say things inadvertently like that, huh~\n\nNo, it’s not as if you did anything wrong. Besides… give the monitor a look.\nWe made out with 76 hearts, while Amagi and Nito earned 72.\n\nHunting is actually more popular outside of Japan. The excitement of being able to see a Japanese bow in such an elegant building probably led to a more favorable impression.\n\nHuh, I see? I didn’t think of that!\nCould it be that you showed off your kyudo anticipating that? As expected of Hasumi-senpai.\n\nHeheh, this is just how we do things~♪\n\nGood grief, you’re getting carried away…\n\nBut let’s keep up this pace for the next one too.\n\nHmm. You&#39;re planning on performing a sword dance next, aren&#39;t you?\n\nHmph, who do you think I am? This is my chance to show off the skills I&#39;ve honed as part of AKATSUKI: taking the traditional performing arts and evolving them into something one of a kind.\n\nInfluence 9\nFifth Day of the Twin Rooster Pagoda, Audience: 100 Elementary Schoolers\nWhile Izumi &amp; Wataru and Nazuna &amp; Hiiro have been working on their appeals the past few days, Keito &amp; Ibuki work on theirs, earning enough to make it to the final round.\n\nWe did it~! We got a pretty high score, didn’t we, Hasumi-san~♪\nYeah. Seems like we got… 78 hearts.\n\nEven so. Your face is too scary when you’re in the presence of little kids? If I hadn&#39;t been tickling Hasumi-san, they all definitely woulda cried and peed their pants~!\n\nGh, you’re incorrigible…..!\n\nThere it is! Hasumi-san’s “Incorrigible”!\nNyahaha, one of your great points is how fast you go through different expressions! So you’d better show it off more~?\nC’mere, smile, smiiile~♪\n\n…… Taki. Next, it&#39;s your turn to be the butt of the joke.\nThe stage is thinning out, so let’s go!\n\nWawah, hold on, Hasumi-san! Do you take me for a cat or somethin’!? If you grab the scruff of my training uniform, it’s gonna stretch out~!?\n\n(I can&#39;t stand being teased... but Taki&#39;s unexpected behavior is a boost for our pair.)\n(We’re certainly still rough around the edges, but the fact is I’m looking forward to the next performance with this guy a little too.)\n\n\n(All that&#39;s left is the performance on the final day. If Taki and I put on the finest performance we can together... we might be able to get a higher score than I thought)\n\nHey, Hasumi-san. The song’s about to start~?\n\nYeah. I&#39;ll give my all with what little time we have left here.\n\nRight! Let’s keep up the pace we’ve got going~♪\n『♪~♪~♪』\nEpilogue 1\nSixth Day of the Twin Rooster Pagoda, Final Show, Audience: 600 Audience Members\t\nIt's the final day, and the participants take the stage.\n\nHm-phh. It seems like everyone’s having a little fun somehow~?\n\nIt&#39;s like they’re writing us off or something! This is a serious situation~!\nFrom opening day up until yesterday, we’ve been the ones getting consistent favorable impressions from the audience. Right?\n\nWell we&#39;ve made a good impression, but we haven&#39;t been given a score that stands out above the rest either. I guess you could call it &quot;footage that makes the final cut.&quot; That&#39;s what we&#39;re lacking.\nBut. Whether we like it or not, this is the final stage. To make sure we’re left with no regrets, we’ve got no choice but to give it our all.\n\nTaki. I sincerely want to thank you.\n\nHuh? Me…?\n\nAt first, I wasn’t sure what would happen. But as our battles stacked up, it began to become clear who you are as a person.\nNaturally, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m seeing you in your entireity, but… Taki Ibuki looks like a loose cannon, yet he’s thoughtful and prudent. He’s like a cold-hearted monster who seems like an innocent child.\n\nHey~ That feels like slander~? My lawyers’ll be hearing about this, y’know~?\nHaha, lay off the joke. That’s what made it a truly fun time pairing up with you. Maybe this is what I wanted to get out of 4piece.\nHow about you, Taki?\n\nMnn~ All I wanted was to follow Yoshihide’s… Nassan’s footsteps and become an idol, but~?\n\n\nA song that makes you think of Japan, nostalgic— It was unforgettable, even across the ocean.\nI never dreamed I’d meet the bizarre idol who belongs to the AKATSUKI that sings that song here, in this place~♪\nNyahaha, I’m the one who should be thanking you! Hasumi-san~♪\n\n…… Yeah.\n\n\nHey, look, that kinda turned into something like a final goodbye, but the audition isn&#39;t over yet~! We gotta show our true potential...☆\nThe battle starts here! Let&#39;s go fight and get what we want, ‘kay~?\n『♪~♪~♪』\nHeheh. You always burst out in song so suddenly……\nBut, this time I’ll get in line with you and sing and dance. Here we go…!\n『~......♪』\n\n『♪~♪~♪』\n\n(Forgive me, Hasumi-san. I told a lie~?)\n(At first, following in Yoshihide’s footsteps was the reason I went through these matches and competitions! But now, what I really want is…)\n\n(... Nyahaha, Life is fun, ‘cuz you never know what’s going to happen~ Dontcha think~♪)\n\nEpilogue 3\nAfter the filming ends, Kuro and Souma meet Keito at the dome pathway to pick him up.\n\nHasumi-dono~! You did a wonderful job…♪\n\nYo. Good work~♪\n\nKanzaki? Kiryu too…? What’s wrong, what made you come here?\n\n\nHah…? ‘Course we’d come to pick ya up. Lil’ Miss got ‘n contact and let us know the last round was just finishin’ up.\n\nYes. We saw Hasumi-dono’s great efforts on the broadcast, but we wanted to be the first to give you our thoughts~♪\n\nThere sure were a lotta great scenes, weren’t there? Made damn sure to record it too~♪\nI never woulda thought that Taki guy coulda possibly known any AKATSUKI songs, though. It felt pretty damn weird hearin’ someone else perform our songs.\n\nThere’s plenty more we’d like to talk with you about. Come, let’s hurry back home~♪\n\nHeheh. I had something to tell the both of you too.\n\nLemme guess. It was when the audience was a hundred elementary school kids ♪ The look on yer face when that happened was just too…—\n\nNo, it’s not that.\n\n\n……?\n\n……?\n\nIt’s something that concerns the both of you too. It’s about Taki Ibuki, the person I paired up with in the Twin Rooster Pagoda…\n\nEpilogue 4\nIn this chapter, Seiya, Nice, Akiomi and Jin give their evaluations of the participants. Nice asks who wants to go first, and Seiya jumps in.\n\nWell then, I’ll jump in with my critiques this time.\n\nOhh. It’s unusual for Seiya-san to raise his hand first…?\nHaha. If a super idol takes the lead on this, there’ll be nothing left for us to say, huh Akiyan?\n\nHeheh. Hidaka-daisenpai4 was very enthusiastic about the evaluation of Twin Rooster Pagoda, so I’m interested in what critiques he’ll give to the idols.\n\nOf course, I haven’t forgotten about the other venues, you know.\nHere in the Twin Rooster Pagoda, the competition was carried out in pairs, so the interpersonal relationships that are essential to the recent unit-system were required as well. I was interested in it too.\nWell then, shall I begin my critiques?\n\nFirst is Keito-kun.\nHe relied on his knowledge and experience to handle everything carefully, but it seemed like everything ended with very little trouble\nHe’s level-headed compared to other idols his age, so I had high hopes for him, but…\nHis intense seriousness worked against him too, so I feel that it was a bit of a waste.\n\nNext, Ibuki-kun.\nHis technique’s unrefined, but his natural physical ability and ability to learn quickly shined through.\nHe drags everyone into following his own pace without getting daunted by the senior idols... I never got tired of watching him take the lead so boldly.\n\nThat’s right. If I were to produce a unit, I’d wanna put someone like him in it.\n\nHeheh. I feel the same. When I’d come across him in America, I thought the talent he’d shown was befitting of a solo idol, but I feel as if I’ve seen a new side of him.\n\nAnd this is the end of the Keito &amp; Ibuki cut of VS AUDIENCE!

You cannot be swimming in the fountain at this age to begin with!\nWell, I am indebted to Buchou-dono.\nAs the one who has shown me the sacredness of the ocean 1, I won’t be the one to tell you something like, “Have you no common sense, that you swim in fountains?”\nYes, this is a problem. This is certainly a problem…! Anyone will do! Is there no person on earth who can save me from this predicament…?\n\nMnn, over there is… Anzu-dono? I might have come up with some kind of decent plan. Anzu-dono! Anzu-dono~!\n\nThere is an urgent matter! I would like for you to loan me your wisdom, Anzu-dono!\nThe truth is… No, it would be quicker if you came and saw it for yourself, instead. I have something I need to discuss with you over there with Buchou-dono.\n\nlet’s line up the [toys] i made in the clubroom~\n[sea slug], [jellyfish], [whale sharkie] too…♪\nit’s not lonely with all of my friends in the ocean…♪\n\nThis is the state of things, it’s thoroughly troubling…\nIf those in the Student Council find out that Buchou-dono swims here, it’s likely they will disband the Marine Biology Club.\nApparently, those in the Student Council consider Buchou-dono to be an eccentric weirdo...? Well, Buchou-dono is one of the Three Eccentrics.\nBut the heads of the Drama Club and Light Music Club are also part of the Three Eccentrics. Out of the three of them, only Buchou-dono is being judged as particularly Eccentric these days, and I must put up with it.\n\nAnzu-dono, I beg of you! Won’t you please just stop Buchou-dono’s eccentric behavior…?\n\nOhh, you’ll take it on for me!? Well then, if you need anything, give me a call, I’ll be right here at the ready…♪\n\npuka, puka…♪\ngood afternoon, anzu-san. are you going to [soak] in the water with us too…?\n\nhm? it would be better if i stopped swimming in the [fountain]?\n\nunderstood~ if it is a request from anzu-san, i cannot refuse, after all.\nanzu-san looks after me quite a lot, so i simply cannot refuse the request of someone i am [deeply] indebted to indeed~♪\n\nBuchou-dono. If you stay there any longer, you will catch a cold. Please use this “tow-eru” I fetched for you.\n\nthank you, souma ♪ if it were summer, my uniform would dry out quickly, but it is already [october], so~\nit might be better to hold back from swimming in the fountain, hm…?\n\nYes. Personally, I’d like for you to refrain from swimming there year round, but… I’d feel awful taking away Buchou-dono’s enjoyment.\nI have to keep a watchful eye on Buchou-dono so he isn’t found out by those in the Student Council. … But I was saved the trouble this time thanks to you, Anzu-dono.\n\nIf it had just been me, I would’ve just been too flustered to have done anything about it…! You have my gratitude, Anzu-dono.\n… You have business with me and Buchou-dono? What sort of business?\n\nHm. You were thinking about holding a lesson with Buchou-dono and I, hm? Naturally, there’s no reason to decline.\nIf we’ll be training our skills as idols together, it may be best for us to switch locations. … Does that work for you too, Buchou-dono?\n\nof course~♪ i am looking forward to having a [lesson] together with you, souma…♪\n\nWell, let us go then. Anzu-dono, Buchou-dono, please come along with me.\n\n\n    After class\n\n\n    Location: Danceroom\n\n\nMm… Mmnm. Mnmnghmn…!\n\n\nwhat is the matter, souma~? your brows are furrowed quite a bit…?\n\nForgive me for my discourtesy, Buchou-dono.\nIt’s… This part of the “ress-son” where we switch uniforms is fine, but it really doesn’t suit me at all— I can’t help but groan…!\n\nreally~? you look very wonderful in your [uniform], souma...♪\ni should be the one saying that. i am worried there is something lacking about the [akatsuki uniform] on me…\n\nRest assured, that is not the case at all…! If anything, it suits you so well, you look as if you are a member of AKATSUKI!\n\nhehehe… you are kind, aren’t you souma…?\nthank you for your praise as well, anzu-san~♪ it helped me get a little bit of [confidence] back.\nthis is the first time i have grasped a [katana], but i will do my best…?\n\nNow then, Buchou-dono. Please brandish the katana and shout like so.\n\n… En garde! 2\n\n\nen garde~♪\n\nB– B-B-B– Buchou-dono! I told you I wanted you to brandish the sword, but it is immensely dangerous to release it mid-swing like that…!\nIt’s good that the sword lodged itself into the floor when it slipped out of your hands, but one wrong move and someone would have died…!\n\ni am sorry, souma… i will reflect on this mistake…\n\nIt’s because I didn’t explain it thoroughly enough. You don’t need to apologize, Buchou-dono.\nBesides, you may have dropped the ball just a moment ago, but you have a sense of it, Buchou-dono. Dare I say, with a few more days of intensive training3, you will have a complete mastery of wielding the katana.\n\nhehehe… this is really fun… ♪ splish-splish (Humming)\n\nAt any rate, Buchou-dono. Please give me your guidance next!\n\nunderstood~ well, please tense your hands and spread them, and give me your right foot~ and turn your body ♪\n\nMn, mnmn.

Don’t touch my sword with those filthy hands! How do you intend on taking responsibility if it rusts because of you?\n\n… Is your sword really that shabby, Souma-kun?\n\nI mean, carrying a sword is a thing of the past, y’know. Isn’t there that whole Act for Controlling the Possession of Firearms or Swords and Other Such Weapons, anyways~?\n\nYou’ve angered me. I won’t allow you to disparage this blade— one bequeathed upon me, one that has been handed down generation-to-generation— as [sha-bee].\nI’ll pluck that life right here.\n\nOop, how dangerous.

It seems like Kanata-kun is thinking of something outrageous in order to participate in it.\n\nYou have a fair point...\n\nWell, it’s as you say. I’ll sheathe my sword just for a bit.\n\nJust a bit? I&#39;d like it if you sheathed it for life.\n\nErr, anyways, Kanata-kun? Everyone in class invited you, and you turned them down, right?\nSo are you participating as a unit?

Given that, it is our duty as club members to obey his will...!\n\nMn~mm, looks like Souma-kyun looks up to Kanata-kun like he's a master, but it's a bit much to force that onto me too, right~?\n\nBesides, it seems it&#39;s more that Kanata-kun wants to have fun with his &quot;friends of the sea&quot;, rather than him looking forward to participating in the festival with us.\n\nmy [friends of the sea] are also precious to me, but kaoru and souma are my precious [friends]...♪\nso i want to do the sports festival with my [friends]. the ones who love the [sea]~\n\nBuchou-dono…!\n\nI understand.\nIf you go so far as to say that, this Kanzaki Souma will think hard and thoroughly for ways that you can participate at the school festival with your &quot;friends of the sea&quot;...!\n\nWait, no matter how hard you think about it, it&#39;s just not going to happen.

What happened? They insisted that they wanted me to do the cover shots just the other day, didn’t they?\nThey were the ones who requested for me to take it on, so what the hell happened?\n\nI’m sorry. I only heard about it through the director, but it seems like the project was halted immediately.\nI heard that a famous idol from overseas was suddenly arranged to come to Japan —\nAnd that it’s even been decided that while that idol is in Japan, they’ll hijack a few Japanese magazines and have photoshoots for them.\nAnd so, under the higher-ups’ orders, it seems that your photoshoot will happen another time.\n\nNo way! No way, no way, no way no way…!\nWhat idol could they have wanted more than me? Who the hell is it?\n\nThis isn’t from a direct source either, so I can’t really be certain of its credibility, but...\nApparently, they’re an idol produced by Nice Arneb Thunder, an accomplished producer from overseas.\n\nMELLOW DEAR US’s 1 Madoka Nozomi-kun… Do you know them?\n\nMadoka Nozomi…?2\n\n\n    Several days later\n\n\n\nIzumi-chan. Did you see the message Tsukasa-chan sent?\n\nYeah. The one about wanting us to take part in 4piece, right?\n\nIt’s basically all hands on deck to demonstrate the prestige of Knights… I think he said. Kasa-kun seriously just decides things all on his own without asking us, doesn’t he?\n\nUfufu. It’s juuust like him… Don’t you think? Like, that kid has a strong fighting instinct.\n\nBut 4piece seems to be an individual competition, so whether I&#39;ll participate or not is a different matter.\nThe reward and the judging of the audition haven’t been made public, so it&#39;s a liiittle too shady for me. That NiceP guy was dressed weird too─ Hard pass for me.\n\nWhat about you, Izumi-chan? With the way you’re talking, it doesn’t seem like you’re going to participate.\n\nI will be, naturally.\n\nYou’re right. There’s no benefit for the modeling group to participate, so一\n\nWait. Izumi-chan? Did you just say you&#39;d participate?\n\nOn the contrary, why were you so sure I wouldn’t?\n\nIzumi-chan, don’t you hate it when Tsukasa-chan decides what we do on his own?\nAnd now, he&#39;s done it again: he contacted us about participating, even passing it off as something mandatory. I thought for sure you wouldn&#39;t join?\n\nI do whatever I want to. While Kasa-kun’s decision annoys me, I would’ve participated with or without it.\nMELLOW DEAR US, was it? Because of all of them coming to Japan, my magazine assignment got canceled. Since that happened, participating&#39;s just the thing I need to kill time, right?\n\nMELLOW DEAR US... Oh, that&#39;s the overseas unit everyone&#39;s been talking about lately.\nI think it passes itself off as some kind of international unit, and it’s produced by NiceP.\n\nYou’re not holding a grudge and doing something like going to challenge NiceP, are you, Izumi-chan?\n\nWho said I’m holding a grudge? I&#39;m just going to prove that I can be active in that space!\nAll I intend to do is make them recognize me as an individual, not just a member of Knights!\n\nIf you&#39;re that angry, I guess I&#39;m right on the money.\n\nIn any case. If even Izumi-chan’s participating, I’ll be the only member of Knights who isn’t going to be applying for 4piece.\nSince everyone else is going to do it, I’d have at least considered it, but…\nI’ve got a job that’s already lined up, so there’s nothing I can do, I can’t act independently.\n\nOn the bright side, I think it’s something like fate that your job was canceled, Izumi-chan.\nI’m expecting great results. You’ll do your best, won’t you?\nIf all the members of Knights get disqualified, I won&#39;t accept it~♪\n\nHmph. There’s no way that not one of us can break through and get selected.\nWe just have to overwhelm everyone around us from beginning to end, and perform well enough to get our efforts recognized for all to see.\n\n\nIt&#39;s a large-scale audition with both established and debut idols coming together to compete, so I know it&#39;s not going to be that easy.\nBut you can’t grab victory unless you&#39;re mentally prepared for all of it, right?\n\nIf I actually stood face-to-face with him, even NiceP would undoubtedly have to recognize my true strength.\nI&#39;ll prove to him myself that Japan has the best idols.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ MELLOW DEAR US is written as メロウ・ディアース↑ Madoka is written with 円 (mado; &quot;round, full&quot;) and 果 (ka; &quot;fruit, accomplishment, result&quot;), while Nozomi is written with 望見 (nozomi; &quot;hope, wish, desire&quot;)."},{"title":"at home","url":"/translation//at_home/","content":"\n\nPartial Translation Disclaimer: This is a partial translation of the @at home crossscout story.\nUnproofread Translations Terms of Service\n  \n    This story is not JP proofread.

Mm~mm… If I had to give my vote, it’d be Hasumi-dono… No, Kiryu-dono, too… But, well… Mn…\n…\n\n… You went dead quiet. Oi, Zakki, who’s it gonna be in the end?\n\nR— Right… For me, I can’t possibly choose between the two of them.\n\nHmm… Well, how about trying to think of it like this? Let’s say Hasumi-senpai and Kiryu-senpai are about to fall off a cliff before your very eyes.\nIf you could only save one of them, which would you rescue, Kanzaki-senpai?\n\nFrom a cliff, you say…?\n\n\n    Fade to black\n\n\n– Kanzaki! I don’t know how on earth this happened, but right now, we’re going to fall off a cliff!\nI’ll be fine! Go save Kiryu!\n\nHasumi-dono…!\n\n\nOi oi, Danna.1 Don’t just go makin’ choices on your own.\n\nOi, Kanzaki. Go save Danna! It’s me, I’ll be just fine— at this height, it’s not gonna matter if I fall, I’m me.\n\nKiryu-dono…!\n\nWhat are you talking about, Kiryu!? There’s a shiver of hungry sharks gathering below the cliff lying in wait!\n\nThat’s exactly why he should leave me behind! Trust these muscles, I can scale back up the cliff myself!\nYou can’t do that, can you Danna? Yer a well-to-do young man2 much more suited for deskwork than athletics.\nEnough with the complainin’, let Kanzaki save you!\n\nI refuse! If it means abandoning you, I’d rather fall first!\nIt’s fine, Kanzaki! Save Kiryu!\n\nHasumi-dono… Kiryu-dono…!\nI… I can’t choose between you…!\n\n\n    Fade back to the commons\n\n\nThe one to fall from the cliff… will be me!\n\n— What!? You, Kanzaki-senpai…?\n\nYes! But I don’t intend to merely sacrifice myself, for you see, I will strike a blow at the sharks with this blade…!\n\nNono, what kinda conclusion is that?\n\nI see. If you can’t save either of them, all three of you will ultimately plummet into the sea.\nBut if Kanzaki-senpai beats the shark in a battle, the likelihood that the three of them are rescued increases.\n\nDon’t analyze it so calmly, you~\n\nBut I respect, aspire to be, and deeply adore both Hasumi-dono and Kiryu-dono the exact same.\nI can’t choose between the two of them…!\n\nHahaha. I hate to butt in while everyone’s so motivated, but the “ES’s Popular Guy3 Contest” isn’t a project about choosing the person you aspire to be, y’knooow?\nAs the name suggests, it’s about choosing to vote for a popular man. Try not to misunderstand that.\n\nBeing popular… What sorts of things makes someone substantially “popular” with people?\n\nIsn’t it a little too late for this? What makes someone popular with people… to sum it up, they’ve gotta be someone with popularity. They’re real cool and someone you can rely on.\n\nA bright, cheerful person— someone who can lighten the mood is popular with people, don’t you think? There’s a sense of security you get from being with them…♪\n\nHm. That holds true for both Hasumi-dono and Kiryu-dono, though?\n\nBoth of them fit…? You~ Try divorcing those two from everything for once. Just split the difference...? — and vote for Adonis or something.\n\nNow, now. There’s still time until the deadline’s up, after aaall. You don’t need to come to a decision on anything here right now.\nThanks for taking it so seriously. Knowing you guys have been touched by this project makes me really happy!\n\nThe ballots aren’t signed, so you won’t be able to tell who voted for who, though.\nCast your votes with a clear conscience– I’m looking forward to it…☆\n\nES' Most Popular Man Contest Chapter 6\n\n…\n\n… Kanzaki? What’s with that gravely serious look on your face?\n\nHasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono… I am at a crossroads right now.\nIn the case that the two of you were to fall from a cliff, which one should I save…?\n\nHaha, what’s with that?\nI don’t really get it, but you should prioritize Hasumi. I can hold my own with my own strength, so I can climb the cliff without your help.\n\nH~m… That’s what I had figured as well, but…\nWhen I think of the unlikely event that Kiryu-dono’s grip slips and he goes plummeting into the sea, I can’t help but feel uneasy.\nI knew it’d be like this, I can do nothing but sacrifice myself and jump into the sea…!\n\nHold on, calm down, Kanzaki. How did you get to this conclusion?\nJust the mere premise of us being on a cliff is impossible to begin with. What on earth happened, did someone put this in your head?\n\nIt wasn’t someone, it is about that one “kontesuto”.\nHasumi-dono and Kiryu-dono. The two of you are people I so dearly respect, so I simply can’t choose.\n\n… By the way, who are you two intending on voting for?\n\nMe? It’s a project that doesn’t interest me, so I wasn’t intending on participating, but…\n\nKanzaki. I’m going to cast a vote for you.\n\nWha… Me?\n\nOhh, what a coincidence, Hasumi. I was thinkin’ the same thing.\nI’ll— put a vote in for ya too, Kanzaki ♪\n\nFrom Kiryu-dono too… Why me? I’m inexperienced, so I must be pretty far off from something like a “popular guy”, though.\n\nThat’s what makes ya a good choice. When it comes to people, you get a way more approachable vibe outta someone who’s a lil foolish.\n\nThat’s right. Besides, it’s terribly charming to see you care so earnestly about this magazine project\nFor me, that’s exactly what I think makes Kanzaki a “popular guy”.\n\nHmm… While I’d like to be evaluated by swordsmanship and samurai spirit, personally...\n\nI’ll accept both of your feelings gratefully. Thank you, sincerely. Hasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono.\n\nYeah. I’ll vote sometime today before the day’s over so I don’t forget. By the way, Kanzaki.\nIn the end, who are ya votin’ for? Me or Hasumi?\n\nTh-That’s...\n\nHmph. Of course he’s voting for me.\n\nNah, nah, it’s obviously gonna be me? Take a look at these muscles. If it’s about manliness, I’m the one who’s got ya beat.\n\nHmph. In this day and age, intelligence is what’s highly valued. I’m the natural choice, aren’t I, Kanzaki?\n\nNo matter how ya slice it, it’s me, right Kanzaki?\n\nUuu… wah, I…\n\nI can’t possibly choose between the two of you…!\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \nTranslation Notes\n↑ Kuro often refers to Keito as 旦那 (danna, lit. master), or &quot;boss&quot;. He'll also use Hasumi-no-danna.↑ Kuro calls him お坊ちゃん (obocchan, lit. young master).↑ モテる (moteru) refers to popularity in the sense of being appealing or attractive to those of the other sex."},{"title":"Getcha Head in the Game","url":"/translation//getcha_head_in_the_game/","content":"\n\nUnproofread Translations Terms of Service\n  \n    This story is not JP proofread.

I’m pretty sure I haven’t done anything to warrant a lecture from you.\n\nI didn’t come over to lecture you. I was going to ask if you’d pair up with me.\n\nAhh, right. We’re supposed to practice tosses in pairs before the match. Yeah, sure, whatever. I&#39;m making it an easy toss, so just toss it back or whatever.\n\nDon’t be lazy, do it seriously. Well, even when you complain you still take class seriously. I trust you&#39;ll do it properly.\n\nIf you&#39;re gonna be a babysitter you don&#39;t need to pair up with me. Your childhood friend Tenshouin is here--- why not ask him instead?\n\nFor whatever reason, he always pairs up with Morisawa before I can ask him.\n\nOh yeah... Now that you mention it... Morisawa and Tenshouin do always seem to pair up for assignments during class, huh.\n\nIt&#39;s a wonderful thing that Eichi has close friends, but... It&#39;s genuinely beyond me why he always wants to pair up with Morisawa before I even get the chance to ask him.\n\nI get you. It stings, like your precious childhood friend is being stolen away.\nThere&#39;s a kid just like that for me --- Yuu-kun. We basically grew up together.\nWhenever Yuu-kun gets buddy-buddy with other people, it pisses me off, and when I see him having the time of his life chatting with other people, it makes my stomach churn.\n\nWait, I don’t feel things to that extent. Also, don’t you think he might hate that clinginess of yours?\n\nNo! I mean, what do you know anyways!\n\n... Right. Well, back during the spring, I was seriously worried that he might actually hate me.\nThese days, we&#39;ve started talking little by little, and from what he&#39;s said, I’ve realized he doesn’t actually hate me\nIf it bothers you that much, why don’t you just ask Tenshouin? Like, “Why do you pair with Morisawa and not me~?”\n\nWe’re not kids. There’s no reason to ask something like that.\n\nYou&#39;re stubborn, you know that...? Well, it&#39;s got nothing to do with me so if that&#39;s fine with you, it&#39;s whatever for me.\n\nHmph. More importantly, enough with the chatter. Let&#39;s get to practicing.\n\nFiiine.

I&#39;m jealous...\n\nIf that’s how you feel, then take him off my hands! Aren’t you two supposed to be close friends?\n\nYep! Tenshouin and I are very good friends ♪\n\nNot really. Chiaki is just a classmate to me.\n\nHere we go again~ Whenever you do a favor, you always say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, we&#39;re friends aren&#39;t we&quot;, don&#39;t you?\nYou get embarrassed calling people friends in front of your classmates, huh? Aren&#39;t you just Mr. Bashful ☆\n\nGood grief, it&#39;s a pain when people misunderstand things. Hey, Chiaki, if you keep this up, I&#39;m disowning you as a classmate, okay?\n\nEhh? Please don&#39;t say that! I&#39;ll apologize, so let&#39;s stay friends...☆\n\nWah, eegh... It&#39;s just like Sena-kun said, you stink of sweat.\nWe’re doing the same drills, but you sweat a whole lot more Chiaki. I envy that metabolism of yours.\n\n\n...\n\nOh, Keito? It&#39;s embarrassing when you sit and stare at me like that. Do I have something on my face? Besides my eyes and nose and mouth of course.\n\nHmph, I&#39;d be amazed if anything else was there.\n\nWell, if I had three eyes, I&#39;d be a monster? If there&#39;s something you want to say, Keito, say it properly. You do have a mouth, right?\n\nHmph. I&#39;m sick of the way you&#39;re speaking.\n\nRight back at you, Keito.

I just noticed you tend to head to him before I even get the chance to say anything is, all.\n\nThat&#39;s because whenever I&#39;m on my own, you seem eager to act like a parent and pair up with me, don&#39;t you?\nI&#39;m not a child anymore, I hate being babied by a childhood friend who’s the same age as me.\n\nBy the way, I pick Chiaki because he’s the most neutral choice in Class 3-A.\n\nI see... You&#39;re right, you’re not the same young kid you used to be. I guess I can&#39;t keep meddling and acting like your guardian all the time.\n\nSee? All it took was a conversation to clear things up. Being treated like a kid gets old by the time you get to elementary school.\n\nI don&#39;t really get it, but should we head to the court?

Just what I figured. I feel like we really stick out from everyone else at this establishment...\nWell, it’s a collaboration with a manga that was insanely popular forever ago, so it is to be expected...\nI’m glad I’m not on my own… Thank you so much for accompanying me, Mashiro-kun.\n\n\nStill, you really don’t mind or anything? If you’re uncomfortable, we can leave as soon as I get what I came for.\n\nOh, no, it’s alright. I don’t really mind this kind of thing, I’m used to it.\n\nYou’re used to it? Really?\n\nYep. Like, every now and then on the way home from work, Mitsuru’ll invite me to go to an all-you-can-eat cafe for bread.\nYou know the way he eats, right? Thanks to that, everyone around us ends up staring.\nCompared to that, today’s definitely more comfortable for me. Nobody seems to care about us.\n\nAhaha. I can definitely see that in my head ♪\nIt’s a relief you’re not uncomfortable! Even if it’s a mission, there’s no way I could force you to do something you don’t care for.\n\nA mission, huh… I’d never read the manga this collaboration is for, so it had me wondering. Who requested it?\n\nMhm! It’s for my mother!\n\nA mission from your mother? Is everyone in the Sengoku family a ninja?\n\nNo, that was basically a figure of speech just now. My household’s exceedingly normal.\nI’ve acted this way for a pretty long time, so they’ve gained an appreciation for ninjas, though.\nAnyways. The manga that’s collaborating with this cafe is one my mother enjoys.\nShe was obsessed with it and read it when she was a teenager. It seems like it was a profoundly memorable series for her.\nIt’s been out of print for a long time, but now, a reprint is being released. This collab was arranged to commemorate that.\n\n\nMy mother is really, really glad, and it looks like she’s been keeping up with the news about it, but it seems like she wasn’t sure about stopping by the cafe…\n“I’d feel a little awkward at a cafe where young people hang out, so could you go for me instead?” was her request. I accepted the task as a sort of “filial piety”.1\nHonestly, there’s a few people here and there that look to be my mother’s age, so I don’t think there was anything for her to worry about, though.\n\nI see. Well, when you give her the coaster, why don’t you let her know it’d be better for her to come on her own?\nLike you said, the consumer base is pretty big. If it&#39;s a place full of people who love the same manga, I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be that embarrassing.\nIt&#39;d be better to experience it for yourself, especially if it’s a series that has so much meaning for you.\n\nOhh… I was thinking of just bringing back some commemorative promotional goods for her, but… that&#39;d definitely be way better for my mother.\nMy mother looked this place up on the internet, so seeing how it looked on the outside, she must’ve convinced herself it was aimed at trendy, young people…\n\nIf that’s the case, she’d definitely want to come if I told her about everything I saw here today!\nThank you for the advice! That’s Mashiro-kun for you. Even today, when I had trouble finding someone to come with me, you called out to me.\nIt’s a collaboration for a manga you didn’t even know about, and you still came to the cafe. Mashiro-kun’s an honorable person you can always rely on…♪\n\nYou’re making too much of it, y’know. Next time I’ve got trouble you’ll be there for me, right?\nBesides, I’ve got work tonight, so honestly, I was trying to figure out how to pass the time until then.\nSo, if anything, you’re the one doing me a favor taking me along with you. Thanks, Sengoku.\n\nNever did I think I’d be the one getting thanked. That’s what you call a Win-Win, huh! Nin-nin…♪\n\n… Oh, our food’s here! Waiter, the “Angels&#39; Doria of Celebration”2 is for me.\n\nThis one’s the “Smiles of Reconciliation Gratin”?3 Heh, it’s got some thickness to it. It looks delicious too.\n\nMashiro-kun, before we eat, how about we check the free coasters we got?\n\nAhh, you’re right.\nWonder what the design is going to be. I don’t know the series or anything, but this kinda thing is still a little exciting ♪\n\nLet&#39;s see, let&#39;s see… Ohh, this is…!\n\nYay! It’s my mother’s favorite character~♪\n\nReally? I’m happy for you, Sengoku.\n\nMhm, we’ve got our hands on a wonderful souvenir! Which design did you get on your coaster, Mashiro-kun?\n\nThis one’s… Do you know which character this is?\n\nJust a little. I thought it’d be rude if I went in completely blind about the manga, so I made sure to skim through it.\n\nOh wow, this is the best friend of the main character! He’s the most popular one— he managed to get inducted in a character popularity contest hall of fame!\nNihihi. Good luck has fallen upon us, huh~\n\nLooks like it. I’ve been kinda wondering what kind of story it is, so I&#39;ll try and see if I can read it online later.\n\nBy the way, why did we get a free coaster for ordering food? Isn’t this the kinda thing you put under a drink?\n\nHmm? Now that you mention it, it’s rather curious.\n\nBut I don’t hate it, you know. Having something small to bring back makes the journey back way easier.\nThe size of this item reminds me of a shuriken! It feels a little familiar ♪\n\nA shuriken? I don’t really think that was the idea.\n… Hey. Here, you take the coaster, Sengoku.\n\nHm? You don’t want it?\n\nWell, I’m not saying that. I just thought it&#39;d make your mom happy.\nIt’d be better if it goes to someone it’s more meaningful to, rather than me, right?\n\nMn~mn. I’m grateful for your feelings, but…\nIt’s something to commemorate our time here today, so if you could, I’d rather you have it, Mashiro-kun.\n\nWhen you put it that way, the same goes for you too, right? You’re giving your coaster to your mom.\nI made some memories, so I don’t really need to have the coaster…\n\n\n— You don’t want it?\nWell, could you give that coaster to Yume then?\n\n… Eh?\n\n… Eh?\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n ↑ Among many things, filial piety is about being good to or taking care of your parents.↑ Doria (ドリア), cooked white rice topped with sautéed meat and vegetables, then topped with a béchamel sauce and cheese, and baked as a casserole.↑ Gratin (グラタン), a dish is topped with a browned crust, often using breadcrumbs, grated cheese, egg or cheese."},{"title":"Perplex Ch. 4-5 (Unproofread)","url":"/translation//perplex/","content":"\nPartial Translation Disclaimer: This is a partial translation of the Perplex crossscout story.\nUnproofread Translations Terms of Service\n  \n    This story is not JP proofread.

It looks as if we are all here!\n\nA good afternoon to you too, Saegusa-dono. I look forward to working with you today.\n\nHehe, it’s a real pleasure to work with you today. This is certainly a strange group of four, isn’t it?\n\nYou said it. It’s more like there’s not a lot we got in common. Well, it’s just a normal drink tasting, so I guess they just grabbed the people who had the free time for it?\n\nThe term &quot;free time&quot; is not something I will overlook. Time is money, and I don’t have an overabundance of it to throw around.\n\nOops, sorry. Shouldn’tve called it free time, huh? &#39;Cuz this is just another job too. \n\nYes, that is exactly right. We cannot sell anything that would damage the image of our offices, after all.\n\nTeehee, isn’t it exciting to see what kind of drinks we’re going to have? You feel the same, don’t you Shinobu-chan?\n\n   Y-Yes! I’m curious too!\n(... Hang in there, Sengoku Shinobu! As a bonafide ninja, I’ll see to it that Yuuta-kun’s prank is a success!)\n\n......\n\n\n“Uh oh~ doing alright over there, Shinobu-kun? You seem a little nervous by the looks of it.”\n\n&quot;Oop, did the cameras start already? The mastermind behind this prank is me, Aoi Yuuta~♪&quot;\n“The truth about this drink tasting is…it’s all a sham! It’s a fake project that was arranged solely for the prank!&quot;\n\n“A little birdie told me that Shiina-senpai from Crazy:B and Cafe Cinnamon was planning on making drinks based on the image of each agency!&quot;\n“I took advantage of the opportunity!”\n\n“Here’s a special thanks for Cafe Cinnamon’s manager! Tha~ank you very much!”\n\n“Now then, no time to delay, lemme fill you all in on the contents of the prank~”\n“This time, the target is… COSPRO’s Deputy Director Ibara Saegusa-sen~pai!”\n“The drinks are all being crafted by Cafe Cinnamon, but the STARPRO drink is actually my mega spicy, little concoction.”\n\n&quot;I’m a spice aficionado, but it&#39;s a drink packed with so much heat that it’d set my mouth on fire, so if the deputy director were to drink it, it’d be a disaster...&quot;\n\n“Of course, the only one who doesn’t know is the deputy director. Shinobu-kun, Kiryu-senpai, and Narukami-senpai are all in on it too&quot;\n&quot;I really just wanted to make the deputy director drink it, but unfortunately, since the plan was to invite one idol from each agency, I had to move things around behind the scenes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Any~ways, with the inside scoop outta the way, I&#39;m gonna have Shinobu-kun and the others make sure the deputy director drinks the super spicy STARPRO drink.&quot;\n&quot;And while the deputy director’s rolling on the floor from sucking down the heat, I’ll come out from a different room and reveal the truth ☆&quot;\n“Now then, now then, what kinda interesting reaction is Deputy Director Saegusa gonna give us? Stay tuned, everyone!”\n&quot;Right, let&#39;s all take a look at the scene of the crime again. C’mon, c’mon...&quot;\n\n\n    Location: Cafe Cinnamon\n\n\nThank you for your patience~ I have with me here your specially-made agency-inspired drinks~\n\nOh my, they’re pretty stylish, aren&#39;t they~♪ I wonder which drink is inspired by NEWDI?\n\nThis one. This time, we asked idols from each agency for their input and created the drinks off of it.\n\nIs this one RhyLin? The color’s the most subtle, so I was thinkin’ it had more of a mature kinda air to it…\n\nRight on the money, Kiryu-kun. Wow~ I&#39;m glad you picked up on it~♪\n\nI see. If I had to say, the flashy, cheerful-looking drink feels as if it’s more befitting of STARPRO, so by process of elimination, this one would be COSPRO.\n\nAhaha. The colors are so vibrant, just looking at them will cheer you up! It looks so tasty~♪\n(… Phew, everything’s going okay. Saegusa-dono doesn’t seem to suspect a thing.)\n\nWell then, take your time, everyone~♪\n\nThanks for going out of your way for us, Shiina-senpai.\nSTARPRO, COSPRO, RhyLin— they all look absolutely scrumptious too~ Could you let me try them later.\n\nYes, of course it’s no problem. I need to evaluate the other flavors so I can properly convey the merits of the COSPRO drink, after all.\n\nAlrighty now, should we try ‘em out?\n\nA-Ah, please wait!\n\nWhat’s the matter, Sengoku? Y’don’t gotta straw or somethin’?\n\nNo, that&#39;s not it. Since we&#39;re already going to the trouble, how about we do the drink exchange first?\n\nWhy would we do that? Wouldn&#39;t it be better to evaluate the taste of our own agency first?\n\nYeah. You’d usually drink from your own agency, wouldn’t ya?\n\n(Eh? Why aren’t you taking my side, Kiryu-dono!? This isn’t part of the plan!)\n\nIt’s not an issue for me. Look, wouldn’t you want to say your own agency drink’s the best if it’s the first one you had?\nIt might be a good idea to give our comments on the flavors of the other agencies to make sure there’s no bias.\n\nR-Right! That’s what I was thinking, that’s why I suggested it!\n\nI see. Well, it’s cool either way. I don&#39;t think it’s gonna matter whether it’s before or after.\n\n(Alright, back on track! Now that we’re here, I’ll just give Saegusa-dono the STARPRO drink and…)\n\nNo, I&#39;m personally against it. I think it would be better to drink the drinks from our own agencies first.\n\n… Eh?\n\nI think we would be able to give more accurate reviews if we started with our drink, cycled through the others, and ended with our drink again.\n\nHm~m, yeah. After knowing all the other flavors, we might pick up on more things we found appealing when we circle back.\n\nNot just that, but in the unlikely event that the COSPRO drink is dubious, I would want to make sure those from other agencies don’t drink it first and become victims themselves.\nI personally think it would be best to be sure the drink is delicious before asking for everyone else&#39;s input. How’s that?\n\nFor sure. If the NEWDI drink isn’t tasty, I can’t recommend it to everyone else.\n\nWelp, it&#39;s just a rough draft, so I guess there&#39;s a chance it’s gonna taste bad. Guess it’s somethin’ that does need a taste-test.\n\n(N-Narukami-dono, Kiryu-dono, wh-why! )\n(If those two drink the drinks from their own offices, I&#39;ll have no choice but to drink the mega spicy STARPRO drink too...!)\n\nOh? Is something the matter, Mr. Sengoku? It seems you haven’t taken a sip of your drink yet…\nWe have an interview to respond to as well, so there’s no time to dawdle.\n\nR-Right~! At this point, there’s nothing I can do but drink it...\n(I have no choice but to prepare myself for the worst. This is the fate of a ninja who has failed his mission…)\nW-Well then… Here comes Sengoku Shinobu~!\n(Sip… Gulp, gulp.)\n\n\n(Cough) …!?\n\nShinobu-chan!? Hold it, what’s wrong? Get it together!\n\nOi, his eyes are rollin’ to the back of his head! Are you okay, Sengoku? Was it the drink?\n\n… So it was a trap.\n\nHuh? Trap?\n\nHow about you show yourself now, Yuuta-kun. I suppose you’re watching us from somewhere.\n\n… I-I’ve been summoned, da-da-da-daaaa~ ♪\nJust kidding. Aha… ahaha….\n\nYuuta-chan!? Wait, that aside, you’ve got a signboard…\n\nIt says “Prank: Huge Success” on it…? So that means Sengoku passed out ‘cuz…\n\nYou’ve got it wrong! I wasn’t pranking Shinobu-kun…\n\nI was the target, right? So, I used the trap to my advantage.\n\n\nIt&#39;d be more appropriate for me to take that sign right now, don’t you think? Should I say “Reverse Prank: Huge Success!” Yuuta-kun?\n\nKh…\n\nThat’s what happens when you snap your jaws at the wrong person. Next time, please make sure to assess the strength of your opponent and choose your prey accordingly, a-ha-ha~♪\n\nChapter 5\n\n    Location: Cafe Cinnamon\n\n\nI’m so annoyed~! That victorious look on the deputy director&#39;s face! It keeps popping up in my head, and it pisses me off!\n\nCalm down. Weren’t you the one who arranged this whole thing, Yuuta-chan?\nIf Ibara-chan noticed what you were up to and retaliated, isn&#39;t that just karma?\n\nYou’re callin’ it karma, but it&#39;s not like Aoi got what was comin’ to ‘im. Sengoku was the one in the crossfires instead.\nOi, you good Sengoku? If you’re feelin’ okay, give us a sign.\n\n\n……\n\nNo good, his soul’s sucked out of ‘im for good. Aoi, tone it down a lil’. Just how spicy didja make it?\n\nSorry. I figured it wasn’t as spicy as I thought, so I got a little carried away.\nI’m sorry to Shinobu-kun, too. He was willing to take part in the prank, but it turned out like this…\n\n(Sigh)… First off, get to linin’ up some chairs over there, Aoi.\nIt&#39;ll be more comfortable for ‘im if we let Sengoku sleep across ‘em rather than me hafta carry him piggyback forever.\n\nYeah, yeah…\n\nAt any rate, I never would have thought that project was a prank...\n\nYeah. It&#39;s surprising how you don’t notice ‘til they get the jump on ya.\n\nNo, no, what are you talking about?! It’s bizarre for you two to say you didn’t know!\n\nEh? What’s that supposed to mean?\n\nWe called you two in to help as instigators, didn’t we? Why wouldn’t you know anything?\n\nYou’re sayin’ that, but we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.\n\n\nGyahaha~♪ That’s a miserable lil’ mug you got there, huh Yuta~♪\n\n  \n  \n  \n"},{"title":"The Princess's Day Off","url":"/translation//princess_day_off/","content":"\n\nUnproofread Translations Terms of Service\n  \n    This story is not JP proofread.

Yume just tripped a little is all.\nNevermind that— Can you just leave Yume alone?\n\nEven with ya sayin’ you want that…\n\nThere should definitely be a rest area around here somewhere. You’d be better off taking a break there for now.\n\n…\n… Something to drink.\n\nMm?\n\n… Yume wants to have something cold to drink.\n\nSo you were thirsty? If that’s the case, there should be a vending machine nearby.\nJust wait here a sec. I’ll go get one for ya right away.\n\n\n    Fade to black\n\n\n… (Breath out)\n\nHow about it, feel a lil’ more settled now?\n\nYeah. A little better than a second ago.\n\n(Sigh) … Where the hell is Esu while Yume is going through this, huh?\n\nEsu. Is that one of the guys that came to Seisoukan with ya?\nI usually see ya two together. You’re pretty damn close, huh?\n\nThat’s right. Esu cannot be without Yume.\nBut, he went off on his own today yet again. He’s really putting Mommy through the wringer.\n\n(... Mommy?)\n\nYume will just say thanks in advance, or whatever.\n\nIt’s not a big deal or anythin’. Let’s put that aside, a second ago, you said you had some kinda business…\n\n\nI kept you waiting, Kiryu-san! Sorry about that. Work dragged on a little longer than I thought!\n\nHm? Oh— I’m pretty sure you’re Yume-san, riiight?\n\n… What a loud voice. Yume’s tired, so Yume would like you to be a little more quiet.\n\nHahaha. I didn’t realize that, I’m very, veryyy sorry.\nBut, how surprising, hmm. Kuro-san and Yume-san mingling amongst each other, I mean.\n\nIt’s not like that. I just happened to meet this one by chance is all.\n\nThat’s right. He just came out of nowhere and started pestering Yume all of a sudden, ‘kay.\n\nI see, I seeee. A strange couple brought together by fortune, indeed! This must be some kind of fate too, hmmm?\nWell, while you’re at it, how about you ask him to help you with your goal, Kuro-san?\nI feel like Yume-san is waaay more suitable to help you with your problem than I am ♪\n\nDon’t say that. You comin’ and meetin’ up here by itself is enough of a help for me.\nBesides, it looks like Yume’s got his own business to attend to.\n\nThat’s right. Please don’t drag Yume into this.\n(Sigh) … Esu might be running off somewhere else in the time we’re standing here.\n\nYou came here to look for Esu, huh.\n\nThat’s right. Yume has been walking around hunting for him since morning, so Yume knows he ended up here.\n\nHmm. But isn’t it hard to find Esu-san with this many people here?\n\nThey’ve gotta be meetin’ up somewhere, aren’t they?\n\nEven if we weren’t meeting up, Yume and Esu would definitely happen upon each other by chance…♪\nIf Yume’s come this far, Yume’s practically already found him, so your help isn’t needed.\n\nHa-ha-ha! What self-confidence, hmm! ☆\n\nWell, as long as you&#39;re safe, I don’t mind.\n\nYume can’t be wasting any more time standing here. Yume will be off.\n\n(...? There’s a crafts store in a place like this?)\n\nWell then, time for us to get to business. I’m pretty sure what we’re looking for’s around here sooomewhere?\n\nMikejima. That store— the one that Yume guy just went into…\n\nHm? Isn’t that the store that has what you came for, Kuro-saaan?\n\nChapter 2\n\nThis material. It looks like I can use it for my next costume.\n♪  Yume is lucky to find it in a place like this...\n\n— Ah. And this one— it fits Yume’s image way better than the one Yume bought before. Yume will get this one too.\n\n\nI&#39;m glad you&#39;re having fun, but don’t you still need to find Esu-san?\n\n… You’re still here? Could it be that you’re stalking Yume?\nYume’s pretty sure Yume told you to leave Yume alone.\n\nAh~ We’re not just followin’ you around, though.\n\nRight. Kuro-san came to buy some merch that was being sold at this store, you knooow.\n\nYou, shopping in a place like this? … If that’s a lie, you’d better come up with a better one.\n\nHaha, it can’t be helped it’d seem that way to ya, huh?\nThe truth is, it’s more so business for my kid sister rather than me.\n\nKid sister…?\n\nKuro-san. Looks like what you came for might be on thiiis corner.\n\nOhh, thanks.\n\nOh, Yume has seen these. Yume&#39;s pretty sure these knit plushies1 are being sold limited-time-only at this chain store.\n\nYeah. I was talkin’ to my sister a while back, and she asked me to buy one for her.\n\nSo which one are you going to buy, Kuro-san? From what I heard, there were all kinds to choose from.\n\nThat’s the problem… Which one does she want?\n\nYour younger sister asked you to buy her one, but you didn’t ask her which one she wanted? Are you stupid?\n\nNo, I did ask her properly. It seemed like there were all different sorts, after all.\nBut… no matter how many times I asked, she wouldn’t tell me which one she wanted.\nI can do stuff like knit, but… I dunno anything to do with this.\nCouldn’t be helped, so I thought I’d ask Mikejima to come meet up and help me decide on which one to buy.\n\nHahaha. I don&#39;t know much about it either, thooough. It’s just that Kuro-san turned to me for help, so I couldn&#39;t refuse.\n\nThere they are! Yume-san probably knows more about this kind of thing, riiight? If you’d like to, please lend Kuro-san your strength!\n\nWell. Yume’s closer in age to my sister than either of us, right? So…\nIf I&#39;m goin’ to the trouble of buyin’ it, I wanna get my sister somethin’ she’d like, so... Yume, couldja help me out?\n\nYume can’t do that.\n\nYou can’t…? Guess you don’t really know this thing well either, hmmm?\n\nPlease don’t look down on Yume. Yume knows about these knit plushies.\nYume can kinda guess which one might be popular.\nThat said, it’s no use to you.\n\n…? What about it is no use?\n\nYume doesn’t know your little sister.\nJust because you choose a popular one doesn’t mean she’s going to like it.\n\nWell, that’s definitely true, but…\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks! Everyone has their own tastes and preferences after aaall.\n\nBut, when it comes down to it, we really can’t do anything but trust Kuro-san’s instincts…\n\n\nIf anything, Yume thinks that’s a better way to go about it.\nThe fact she didn’t answer you when you asked doesn&#39;t mean that any choice is fine...\nSo it’s more natural to think that she wanted the one that you would choose for her.\nSo, it’d be wrong to ask Yume for Yume’s opinion. It should be something you think over and decide.\n\nI see. It’s not what you give that makes someone happy, but the time and thought you put into it that does.\n\nThat’s right~♪\n\nSo then if I do that…\n\nGot it. Thanks Yume. You too, Mikejima.\nAlrighty. Guess I’ll choose the one that seems like she’d enjoy it…\n\n\n    Time passes\n\n\nUfufu, what an unexpected haul, Yume’s happy as can be.\n\nI get that you’re happy, but pay attention and walk forward properly. You’re just gonna trip again.\n\nYume knows that without you saying it. Don’t treat Yume like a kid, please.\n\nBesides, that’s the one you need to be more mindful of.\nPlease don’t forget you’re holding Yume’s precious material.\n\nRight. Leave it to me! I’ll protect the things you bought with my liiife!\n\nThat’s why Yume is telling you to stop jostling your arms so vigorously like that.\n\nLooks like we stayed out pretty long today, though. It’s already the end of the day.\n\nWell, we did spend a good amount of time keeping Yume-san company shopping after.\nCome to think of it, Yume-san. Aren’t you glad we didn’t search for Esu-san in the end?\n\nWhatever. He might be back at the dorms by now.\nWe didn’t find Esu, but I managed to get my hands on lots of my favorite material, so… It wasn’t a bad day off  ♪\n\nHm? Over there… could it be…?\n\nWhat’s up, Mikejima? Didja see someone you know?\n\n...!\n\nOi, Yume. Don’t just break out into a sprint like that, it’s dangerous!\n\nHa-ha-ha! Yume-san’s got the legs of an Olympian, being able to run after walking around so much!\n\n\nEsu~♪ Yume finally found you…☆\n\nUhyah!? My back got heavy all of a sudden…– Huh? Yume?\nCould you not cling to me so suddenly? What are you going to do if my heart stops?\n\nWhen that happens, Yume will take responsibility and bring you back to life.\n\nI’m telling you not to startle me in the first place, though!?\n\nJust like I thought, it&#39;s Esu-saaan!\n\nHuh? Mikejima-shishou and Kiryu-senpai? I didn’t expect to come across you guys in a place like this.\n\nMikejima… -shishou?2\n\nHey now, Esu-san. I said it before, but I don’t remember becoming your Shishou, y’knooow?\nI’m really not the kinda person you should be calling Shishou.\n\n\nHow humble! I heard Mikejima-shishou is something like an amazing gentleman that’s gallivanted all around the world, so!\nIt’s only right to call you Shishou, or rather, please let me call you that way! I’d like to call you Daishishou3 if I could!\n\nHahah. Looks like he imprinted on ya, Mikejima.\n\nHm~mm. … Guess it’s not a bad feeling to be admired, riiight?\n\nHey, why did Esu go and run off without telling Yume…?\nIf you’re ever going out, you need to tell Yume where you’re going at all times\nEsu didn’t tell Yume anything, so Yume got stuck having to look for you everywhere.\n\nNo, I don’t want you following me around, so I’m not going to tell you anything.\nI mean, you said you were searching all day, but you didn’t involve Mikejima-shishou and Kiryu-senpai with you, did you!?\nSorry, it looks like he caused you trouble. Those are his bags without a doubt!\nHere, I’ll take them! Please let me take them!\n\nDon&#39;t worry about it! Yume-san hasn&#39;t caused us any trouble.\n\nYeah. If anything, thanks to Yume comin’ along, I learned all sortsa stuff.\n\n(Sigh) That’s good, then. … Seriously, you should be thankful to our seniors, you know?\n\nEsu. Yume is completely worn out from walking everywhere today. Yume thinks a gift for a hardworking Mommy would be nice.\n\nWho’s the son and who’s the mommy here, exactly? I mean, are you listening to what I’m saying!?\n\nOf course. Yume is Esu’s mommy… right ♪\n\nJust because you say it with such a happy face doesn’t make it true, hear me?\n… A gift, huh.\nI’ll go buy you some juice from that vending machine, then. Here, what do you wanna drink?\n\nMmnm… That’s not the kind of atmosphere Yume was going for…!\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ Amigurumi (あみぐるみ) are small crocheted stuffed animals.↑ Shishou (-師匠) is an honorific used for a master (usually in a specific craft).

Kiryu-dono, may I have a moment? I was entrusted to pass these documents on to y...\n\n…!? Wh-What in the world is this!? Clothes are scattered everywhere in the dojo, isn’t this just a complete mess!\n\nOh-oh!? Lying slumped under that pile of clothes over there is— Kiryu-dono!?\n\n……\n\nThis can’t be— Was this accosting from the likes of robbers and thugs!?\nKiryu-dono! Please hang in there, Kiryu-dono! What on earth happened here!?\n\n\n… Mm? Mmngh… (Huff). Damn... musta dozed off.\n\nOugh. What’s wrong, Kanzaki? You look like a deer in headlights, y&#39;know?\n\nKiryu-dono…! What a relief, you’re okay!\nWIthin the dojo was this terrible scene– You were slumped in the center of it, Kiryu-dono! I thought for certain that you’d been attacked!\n\nHm? Oop, how&#39;d this big ol&#39; disaster happen? Guess I got too sucked into my work and lost track of my surroundings.\n\nSorry for scarin&#39; ya, Kanzaki. Nothin&#39; like that went down. I was makin&#39; outfits like always, but I guess I dozed off midway through.\n\nMaking outfits... I am glad I had the wrong idea, but... What do you mean by making outfitis, anyways, Kiryu-dono?\nDidn&#39;t you make a considerable number of outfits for the &quot;Harouiin Paatii&quot; recently?\n\nBesides, I seem to recall that the last time &quot;Harouiin Paatii&quot; ended, there were no big events at the academy for a while...\nI—Is... There something I forgot about?\n\nNah, it&#39;s like you said. There&#39;s no events comin&#39; for a while.\n\nThen why? There&#39;s far too many of these outfits for this to be &quot;light hobbywork&quot;...\n\nAhh, it’s not anythin’ for an event.\nLook, y’know how I had that small part as a teacher in the TV drama before?\n\nHm? If I remember correctly… that was the job Nagumo and the others helped you practice for, right?\n\nYeah. The director saw the outfits I made myself and got super interested in &#39;em. These ones are ones he asked for.\nFrom what he said, apparently these are gonna be used in the next drama. So they&#39;re an official commission.\n\nAs expected of Kiryu-dono! What a wonderful turn of events!\n\nI dunno whether it’s impressive or anythin’ though… Well, it&#39;s somethin&#39; to be grateful for, someone bein&#39; interested in my work.\n\nBut to be recognized by a &quot;pro&quot; is wonderful! It&#39;s because Kiryu-dono&#39;s outfits are outstanding masterpieces, each and every one. I am happy for you too ♪\n\nHaha. Thanks, Well, that&#39;s what I was workin on, but... Guess I fell asleep before I knew it.\nYou helped me out, comin&#39; here and wakin&#39; me up. If I just stayed out like a light like that, I wouldn&#39;t be able to bear it.\n\nHm? Wait, what’d ya come here for? Didja have business here?\n\nAh. I almost forgot. The teachers requested for me to bring this to you, Kiryu-dono.\n\nHm? Ahh. It’s an expense form for the Halloween Party, huh?\nIt&#39;s &#39;cuz that thing had me going way over budget, huh... It was weighing on me, but it looks like the academy&#39;s letting me write it all off as an expense. What a lifesaver.\nThanks for bringin’ the form over, Kanzaki.\n\nNo, the pleasure is mine!\nBut this so-called &quot;Harouiin&quot; is such a mysterious special occasion, isn’t it? Dressing up as vengeful spirits, seeking for &#39;tricks&#39; and &#39;treats&#39; and the like…\n\nWhat? Is this gonna be your first Halloween, Kanzaki?\n\nYes. We don’t have anything like that back home. We didn’t have it in school either, so…\n\nAh~ yeah, that&#39;s right. Last year was a real tumultuous one, so there weren&#39;t any events. Huh. I thought you were used to it since you handled it pretty well. It&#39;s really your first time?\n\nDo you think so? It was certainly frantic then, though... It seems that the lessons Hasumi-dono gave me about customs beforehand were successful.\nHave you ever done anything for &#39;Harouin&#39;, Kiryu-dono?\n\nYeah. Well, just &#39;cuz of my kid sister, though. Mom would make costumes for us.\nWhen Mom passed away, I ended up takin’ over makin’ costumes. I stuck with it ever since I guess.\n\nHeheh. That sounds fun.\n\nWell, I was way too busy this year to make something too elaborate, though.\n\nI suppose it&#39;s because you&#39;ve been overwhelmed, Kiryu-dono.\nEven with outsourcing the outfit-making to the staff and the help of the handicraft club, it seems that you are still short of hands.\n\nI was considerably worried about you— Hasumi-dono as well. Kiryu-dono, wearing himself out day by day...\n\n...? Was it that bad?\n\nTerribly so! You were more of a walking dead man than any of the students dressed as such! And yet, you couldn&#39;t be stopped...\n\nReally? That time&#39;s all a blur for me...\nUhhh, that had to be when...?\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n"},{"title":"Keito Idol Story 2","url":"/translation//keito_idolstory_2/","content":"\n\nUnproofread Translations Terms of Service\n  \n    This story is not JP proofread.

Anzu asked us to… No, to be more precise, it was a request from the work staff of a television program we’re appearing on soon.\nAs they’re doing a special feature on AKATSUKI, it seems they’d like photos other than professional ones.\n\n\nOn top of that, they asked us to take photos ourselves... I&#39;ve never taken a photo of myself with a smartphone.\nI&#39;m a little worried we won’t be able to take the kind of photos they’re looking for.\n\nWell, we’ll get it done one way or another. All we gotta do is take pictures of ourselves.\nCompared to bein’ forced to hunt boars in the mountains or make a life on a deserted island, this is a breeze.\n\nWhat on earth are those examples?\n\nBut, well, you’re not wrong. Should we get started, then?\n\nLet’s see, to get this camera into selfie mode, I’m pretty sure you gotta press this part of the screen, right…? Oh, it switched.\n\nI don’t tend to look at my face unless there’s a mirror. It’s kinda embarrassin’...\n\nHm… At this angle, there’s quite the emphasis on your jaw.\nYou have to keep the subject of the picture in mind while adjusting the position of the camera at the same time, huh? It’s quite tricky.\n\n…\n\nKanzaki, you’re staring quite intently at the smartphone. You might be unfamiliar with the technology, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use it, right?\n\nRight. Thanks to Yuuki-dono, it’s gotten to where I can use it better than before.\n\nHowever, I’m not as well-taught with the functions of “kamuras”. Why is self-photography called something like a “seru-fii” in the first place?\nI don&#39;t have to pay a fee to use my phone, do I...?2\n\nFee…? Ahh, I thought you’d been weirdly quiet for a while now…\nListen, Kanzaki. “Take a selfie” comes from the words “self” and “taking a picture”. It has nothing to do with fees.\nGive me your smartphone, I’ll set up the camera for you.\n\nI am deeply indebted, thank you.\n\nBut why did they request us to take pictures of ourselves?\nIf we are going to use them on the program, wouldn&#39;t having a &quot;kamura-man&quot; take them have it come out better?\n\nI was curious too. I asked Anzu about it.\nApparently, the production team wanted us to show our natural selves to the viewers so they&#39;d feel closer to us.\n\nEven so, I think it&#39;s going to look unnatural having us do something we usually don&#39;t... How incorrigible.\n\nAlright, there. You should be able to take pictures now. Here you go, Kanzaki.\n\nYou have my thanks, Hasumi-dono.\n\nHmm… Is this how you take the “seru-fii”?\n\nOi, oi, Kanzaki. Turn the phone around. Look at the screen, not the camera on the backside.\n\nMnmn, I’ve appeared on the screen! How does the “ren-zu” of the “ka-mera” capture me when it’s not facing towards me…!?\n\nThere’s a front-facing camera on the same side of the screen. There&#39;s nothing that changes from when you take a normal picture... Well, I guess you wouldn’t get it if you’re not familiar with the camera features.\nJust press the big white circle on the screen, Kanzaki. It&#39;s simple, give it a try.\n\nRight! Putting my index finger on the big white circle… Ha!\n\n\nWhat on earth—!? Hasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono! The sound of the shutter won’t stop…!\n\nCalm down, Kanzaki. Try taking your finger off the white circle.\n\nMn… It stopped. Phew, that’s Hasumi-dono for you! You guide with a steady hand!\n\nHaha, how many shots didja take? Let&#39;s see.\n\nMnmn. There are plenty of photos of me with my eyes wide with astonishment.\nBut the focus is off. Maybe because I moved my smartphone in a hurry... I couldn&#39;t get a good shot, how frustrating.\n\n… Well, if anything, isn’t that your natural self?\n\nI&#39;m so aware of the camera, the expressions I make look no different from my promotional materials. How about you, Kiryu?\n\nWhat are you askin’ me for… I&#39;m no better than you, Danna. I just stare blankly into the camera, and it ends up turnin’ out like an ID photo.\n\nHm~mm. We’re not going to come up with any ideas like this. Let’s look it up on the internet.\n“Selfie”, “pose”... Hm, it seems like there’s lots of photos where they’re putting their palm on their cheek. I wonder if there’s a reason they’re doing that.\n\n... Ohh, it makes your face look petite. When you cover your cheek with your hand like that, it conceals it, I see.\nSelfies aren’t just about taking pictures, but being creative enough to enhance the appearance. Maybe idols and selfie culture have something in common.\nWell, I&#39;ll give it a shot. I’ll put my left hand on my cheek, and with my right hand… (Click).\n\nHow’s it look? Did it turn out good?\n\nShow me too— I would like to see Hasumi-dono’s gallant figure ♪\n\nHm. I thought it came out good, but… Tell me what you think, be completely honest.\n\n… Ah~... Well, isn’t it fine the way it is?\n\n? Oi, Kiryu. What are you looking away for? … What do you think, Kanzaki?\n\nH~m. It might be because of the way your mouth isn’t smiling, but… It makes you look like you have a cavity, and you’re pushing past the pain for the picture.\n\nWh— A cavity…!?\n\nAh~ … He just up and said it.\n\nWhat?! Did I say something I shouldn’t have?\n\nI’m sincerely sorry! Hasumi-dono said to be completely honest… No, that sort of excuse is shameful. As a proper samurai, I will apologize with this seppuku…!3\n\nHold it, Kanzaki, I always say it, but you don’t need to perform seppuku for something like this. … I was just embarrassed about how good I thought it came out.\n\nMaking mistakes over and over is how people grow. If we try it a few more times, we should be able to get better at taking pictures. Let’s take turns practicing.\n\nUnderstood. I’ll aim for the white circle, and… Hah!\n\nMnmn. The background looks sharp and clear, but for some reason, my figure is blurred. Is it because the “ka-mera” hates me?\n\nIsn’t it ‘cuz the focus isn’t on yer face? Gimme that for a sec.\n\n(It&#39;s funny to see two guys huddled around a small smartphone together... Here, I’ll take a picture.)\n(... Hmm, that turned out pretty good. It’s easy when it’s like this.)\n\n(That&#39;s right. We don’t need to limit ourselves to taking selfies. We can take pictures of each other.)\n(If anything, that would be a better way to show what the production team wanted to see— our &quot;natural selves&quot;.)\n\nKiryu, Kanzaki, come here for a second. I think I’ve come up with a game plan. I feel like if we can get some good, natural photos if we do it this way.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ In Japanese, words from other languages (such as English) are typically rendered in katakana. However, when Souma uses katakana words, they are all written in hiragana instead, likely to emphasize how he struggles with foreign words. These words are kept as written in hiragana, and put in &quot;quotes&quot;. The word for selfie is じどり (shidori), but I chose to localize this to セルフィ/せるふぃ (serufii).↑ The original play on words is 鶏 (tori; chicken) and じどり (shidori; selfie). The original line is &quot;鶏と写真にどのような因果が……&quot; (What sort of relationship do chickens and photography have, anyways...). I chose to localize this to keep the wordplay aspect.↑ Souma's running gag is regularly resorting to performing seppuku to make up for trouble. 切腹 (seppuku or harakiri, lit. belly-cutting ) was a form of ritualistic suicide samurai used for a variety of reasons. For Souma, that tends to be shame."},{"title":"Youth Radio","url":"/translation//youth_radio/","content":"\n\n\n    .preview-wrapper { /* in case jquery doesn't work */\n        display: none;\n    }\n    @media (max-width: 567px) { /* for NexT Mashiro: makes padding smaller on mobile */\n        .post-block {\n            padding: 5px 10px 8px !important;\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                Youth Radio\n                青春RADIO\n                \n                    Start Reading\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Nazuna is busy, so Shinobu and Makoto will handle the broadcast!

But I guess if people were here in the classroom, I might not be able to concentrate on my script.\nIf anything, the peace and quiet’s even better for focus. Alright, let&#39;s hurry up and get this done before everyone gets here~♪\n\n\nMorning~♪\n(Like I thought, no one’s here. Yeah, I&#39;m the first one~♪)\n…\n\n\n(“Spread out the writing paper,” I said. “Let’s write!” I said. But I’ve got my pen and… I’m at a total loss. I have no clue what to write.)\n(Up ‘til now… Or rather, since Anzu-chan enrolled here at school, the Broadcasting Committee didn’t have that much work to do.)\n(Of course, we did stuff like picking what plays for the lunchtime broadcast and making news announcements, but...)\n(There were regulations the student council mandated on us, so we couldn&#39;t do whatever we wanted. It was like the same tired pattern every time.)\n(I didn&#39;t wanna do that, so I’d go to the shopping district by school to find some good tracks for a good price.)\n(But fine and its leader, the student council president Tenshouin-senpai, fell in the DDD and the absolute monarchy went with it.)\n(DreFes has also changed a lot with the restoration of the temporary unit system and the establishment of S3)\n(Now, we can broadcast whatever we want without worrying about what the student council says, so Nito-senpai’s got crazy winds in his sails.)\n(He was writing a script for an in-house school television program the other day. He kept at it, gathering all the materials and deciding on the program, even though he was sleep-deprived.)\n(Compared to that, I’m no good, huh…? I keep relying on Nito-senpai, and I can’t even write a lunch broadcast script from scratch.)\n… No, I can’t just get depressed about this! I’m on duty the day after tomorrow, so I have to lock in and get it done!\n(To make sure Nito-senpai can rest easy and leave things to us, me and Shinobu-kun have to prove we can reliably do it ourselves～♪)\nAaalrighty, I can do this! The theme will be… I’d rather it be more fun to listen to than stuffy.\nFun content, fun content… what makes me feel like I’m having fun? When I’m eating?\nAh, a favorite food tier list might be good!\nHeheh, well done, me! Sure enough, what the work this term needs is long-term persistence!1\n♪～♪～\n… Uwaa!? Anzu-chan? Um, how long have you been here~?\nB-By any chance, did you hear what I said a second ago?  What… I-It’s the best joke I could come up with.\nAh, you don’t have to tell me your thoughts, Anzu-chan! I saw your reaction, it told me all I needed to know…\nTh-That aside, things like coming to school early is pretty commendable.\n… Me? I’m on duty for the lunch broadcast the day after tomorrow, so I came to school ahead of time to try and think up a good script~♪\nI can’t really concentrate at home, so I usually get a lot of scripts done at school or the library. But the library’s not open yet at this hour, so…~\nHm? Where are you going with that bag, Anzu-chan? Ah, did you forget something at home?\n“If I stay here, I&#39;ll get in the way…”? Well, you’re not a bother at all! If anything, I’ll make even better progress if you’re here, Anzu-chan!\nYou were worried about the direction of the next live? If you’re looking for some inspiration for the music, lemme help!\nLet’s see… You’ve already figured out the script, but you haven’t picked the music yet, right?\nI see, I’m a member of the broadcasting committee, y’know~♪ Coming up with scripts it part of it, but I also have to decide what songs to play~♪\n\nThe broadcasting regulations have been lifted, so even if we play songs by school idol units, it won’t end up being just student council music anymore.\nSo, we could use those, but…  I’d like to use different ones if I can, y’know?\nI think it’s really important for idols to expose themselves to new music and develop their artistic sensibilities.\nEven chefs think, “I want to make food like this and make people happy too,” when they taste something delicious, right?\nIt’s the same thing.\nYour perspective’ll be narrow if you just limit yourself to what’s in school~ But if you can see things from a broader point of view, I think that helps you grow as an idol too.\nWeeell, I&#39;m probably saying some real arrogant stuff. Anyways, we finally have the freedom to do whatever we want, so…\nI figured, why not make use of that?\nSo, uhh… R-... Remember the time I told you I was looking for good, cheap tracks at the second-hand store near my house?\nGood. You remembered~♪ Yeah, so, this time I was thinking of taking another look around the store.\nI-I was wondering, if you’ve got the time, Anzu-chan, would you help me pick something out?\nIf you’re looking for a song too, it’d be like killing two birds with one stone right…?\nEh? “How about we go looking tomorrow after school”... Waah, really!? Really really!?\nThanks, Anzu-chan~♪ I always stick with my own tastes when I pick out songs, so they all tend to be pretty similar.\nBut, if you’re there for me to ask for your input, we might find even better music～♪\n\n\nOh, I thought it was pretty noisy, but it was just you guys?\n\nHuh? Isara-kun? You’re in the class over, aren’t you?\nMm~ I was just on my way to get some student council work done when I overheard you guys talking.\nIt made me think, “Man, getting up this morning, how admirable, good for you guys~♪ “ when I peeked inside. It seemed like a fun conversation, so I called out to you.\nYeah, it was. You were working late on student council stuff yesterday too, weren’t you…?  Don’t push yourself too much, okay?\n\nHaha, thank youuu~\nI mean, I do my part, but the vice president works way harder than I do.\nIt just doesn’t feel right to head home early when people above you are still working, right?\n\nAhh, yeah. I tend to ask Nito-senpai if he&#39;s staying late too, like, &quot;Is there anything I can help you with?&quot;\nI know how you feel, Isara-kun.\n\nIt&#39;s tough for both of us when we each have such serious superiors, huh~ Well, way better than having a slacker in charge ♪\nAhaha, right you are.\nWe could probably go on forever about this, but I&#39;m curious to know what you guys were talking about. If you don&#39;t mind, lemme in on the conversation too...♪\n\nChapter 2\n\n    Location: Classroom\n\n\nYou’re as busy with student council work as always, huh Isara-kun?\nI was asking for advice on what to do for the lunch broadcast.\nAnzu-chan had a similar kinda problem, so she said she’d go to the shopping district with me next time…?\n\nThe shopping district? Ahh, I’ve been to a secondhand store there once or twice.\nThey’ve got a pretty good selection, don’t they?\nEven so, a date with Anzu, huh? Talk about the springtime of youth, Makoto~♪\nEhh? It’s not a date!\nI&#39;m just asking Anzu-chan to help me find a track to play on the lunch broadcast, it’s not something as deep as a date!?\nG-Got it, no need to get wound up.\nNow that you mention it, that one guy’s in the Broadcasting Committee… but I wonder if he’s doing a proper job.\nWho, Shinobu-kun?\nYeah, him. Sengoku says things like he’s “born in darkness and lives in darkness”, so I don’t get the feeling he’s the kinda guy that wants to stand out right?\nHe’s got a pretty awful fear of strangers too. He can’t make eye contact or string a word together when it comes to people he doesn’t know very well, or people he’s meeting for the first time.\nWell, I guess he doesn&#39;t have to talk to people when he has to broadcast, so it should be fine. Still, I just can’t help but worry…?\n\nHe’s usually with Nito-senpai when he’s on duty, so I don&#39;t think he gets so nervous that he can’t broadcast.\nShinobu-kun’s on lunch duty tomorrow, so if you’re worried, you could come see for yourself? I bet Shinbou-kun would love it if you came to see him, Isara-kun ♪\n\nYou sure? But I’m in the student counc… Well, wait. I guess the student council doesn’t really have anything to do with it anymore.\n\nThat&#39;s right. Our… With Anzu-chan’s might, we made some major change in Yumenosaki.\nWe can move around with a lot more freedom compared to before. It&#39;s become an age of freedom of the press!\nIt’s not just the music, but our scripts too. We don’t need the student council to look at them before we broadcast anymore. Thanks to that, Nito-senpai is fired up~♪\nI was just writing a manuscript ‘til a short while ago, but it was pretty fun… I had trouble coming up with a theme at first, but I might say even that was fun too ♪\n\nIs that right? Errr, Sengoku-san’s tomorrow at lunch, huh. Lemme get work done right away and watch over his efforts…♪\n\nPlease do. ... Are you gonna watch him too, Anzu-chan? Shinobu-kun seems to be attached to you too, so I think he’d be happy to see you～♪\nNito-senpai’ll probably be there with you, but maybe I’ll come and scope it out too…\n\n\n    Location: Classroom\n\n\nCh-Chairman-dono… Auuauu…\n\nShinobu, if all you say is “auau”, I’m not gonna understand what you want from me~?\nIf something’s making you worry, just come to Ni~chan about it. I’m everyone’s reliable Ni~chan, so I’ll settle any problem you have☆\nCh-Chairman-dono~!\n\nWh-Whoa!? Sh-Shinobun, it’s fine if you cling to me, but you have to stop tackling my stomach… Uuu, I feel like I’m gonna throw up…\n\nI-I’m sorry, Chairman-dono! Ummm, ummm, there’s no bowl or container around here… Shall I use my hand?\n\nTh-Thanks, Shinobun. But, there’s no way I’m seriously going to throw up in your hand, okay?\n(Inhale, exhale)...♪ Alright, I’m fine already. Ni~chan’s made a full recovery ☆\nThere there, Shinobun, what’s the matter?\n\nI’m on duty for tomorrow’s lunchtime broadcast, right? It’s such a prominent, important job, of course there’s nothing I can do but worry and worry about it…\n\nHmm, I guess it’d be tough for you to do it solo after all?\n\nI’m a member of the Broadcasting Committee too. I didn’t want to bother you Chairman-dono, so I thought up a script and selected music.\nBut, as soon as I got in front of the mic, I completely froze up, and it seems like I accidentally broke it… C-Chairman-dono~!\n\nAhー There, there. Don’t cry, Shinobun. Everyone makes mistakes, y’know~? Let’s just be careful and try not make the same mistake next time it happens~♪\nBut, but, I don&#39;t feel like I can do it… Even thinking about the *possibility *of making a mistake again makes me balk.\n\nYou’re still just a needy kid, aren’t you Shinobun…?\nAlright, just this once, Ni~chan’ll help you out. You’ll try your best to do it by yourself next time, right?\n\nChairman-dono~! You’re a goddess~♪\nHey, just because I look feminine doesn’t mean I’m a girl.\nWell, whatever. Shinobun, If you’re set on doing something so ambitious, get to practicing right away, okay?\n\n\nExcu~use me~♪\nOh, Makochin. Come in~♪\n\nHey, Nito-senpai. Shinobu-kun.\n\nHello~ Have you come to ask Chairman-dono for help about the broadcast too, Yuuki-dono?\n\nAh, yeah. I was working on the script for the lunch broadcast in a couple days, so I thought I’d see if Nito-senpai could help me out.\n\nYou’ve already thought about it, Makochin. That’s awesome~♪\n\nI-It’s not a big deal. Honestly, I was supposed to turn it in last week, but I was rushing around and I ended up being totally late.\n\nTrickstar’s been busy running around with interviews and all that, huh~?\nAs an idol, having work coming around’s a good thing, so I know juggling club activities and committee meetings has gotta be tough.\nBut, we’re not just idols. We’re students too. You should have as much fun as you can living school life while you still can.\n\nNito-senpai, it was like this before, but these days you seem even more involved in club activities than ever.\n\nUp until now, there were things we couldn’t do. Now we can, right? So I want to do anything and everything I can before I graduate.\nThat’s exactly why even with shaving off a few hours’ sleep, it’s fine~\n… (Yaaawn) ♪\n\nThat was a ginormous yawn!? The bags under your eyes are really deep Chairman-dono. You should get a good night’s sleep?\nWell, I’m the type to stay up really late too, so getting up in the morning’s really tough.\nNinjas are destined not to live under the sun. Even now, I still feel like bundling up in the covers.\n\n\nSorry to interrupt the excitement, but I&#39;m coming in~\nNito… you’re here. I need to speak to you for a moment, do you have a minute?\n\nChapter 3\n\n    Location: Classroom\n\n\nSagami-sensei…? What did you want from me?\n\nHey, don’t be so on guard~? It’s nothing bad for you, so take it easy.\n\nPhew…\nMakochin, Shinobun, I’ll go talk to a teacher, so wait here. If it gets too late for you, you can go home early.\nI’ll give the key to Makochin. Well, take care of the place～♪\n\n…\n\n…\n\n(Umm, what do I do? Nito-senpai’s not here anymore, it’s just me and Shinobu-kun in the broadcast studio.)\n(When I really think about it, it’s been a long time since it’s just been the two of us).\n(Even though we rotate who’s on air, the three of us are still usually together.)\n(Hm, is Shinobu-kun a little restless? It seems like he’s trying to come up with something to talk about.)\n(If I don’t reach out to him now, we’ll be dancing around each other all year!)\nTh-The, uh… The weather’s nice today, isn’t it?\n\nS—So it seems.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n\n(Huh? Did I take the wrong approach on the subject…? It was just a conversation about the weather, didn’t I?)\n(Maybe I’ve read too many books about talking to girls… It’s like I completely forgot how to speak.)\n(But, I can’t just give up like this. Be brave, me, I’m Yuuki…♪)\nShinobu-kun, you’re friendly with Isara-kun, right? Do you go out for fun on your days off?\n\nT-To say we’re friendly would be discourteous to him~! He is like my lord, so to speak! Isara-dono is someone I am deeply indebted to, after all.\nIf it’s for Isara-dono, I’d do any task he gives me, no matter how hard it is~♪\n\nAhaha, Shinobu-kun really looks up to Isara-kun huh? I guess he’s just so caring and helpful, of course his juniors adore him.\nAnzu-chan’s like that too. I’ve gotta do my best to follow their leads huh…\n\nTh—That’s right–!\n\nW-Wah— why’d you shout all of a sudden?\n\nThere are two people I’m deeply indebted to~\nI am indebted to Isara-dono for looking after the Ninja Association and supporting it from time to time, and I am indebted to Anzu-dono for saving my life.\nI was so surprised by the fact I have two people I’m indebted to that I yelled~ I am indebted to Chairman-dono too.\nSo I’ll have to hone my ninja skills even further to repay those to whom I am indebted.\nOkay then, Yuuki-dono. What sort of ninja skills do you need of me?\n\nEhh?! Even if you say that, I don’t know much about ninja skills…\n\nThe most famous ninja techniques are the Replication Technique and the Transformation Technique, along with the Fire Escape Technique and Water Escape Technique\nThe Replication Technique is an optical illusion, where you make it look like many of you have appeared, while the Transformation Technique is where you transform into an object like a log.\nAs the name suggests for the Fire Escape and Water Escape Techniques, you use fire or water to escape from your enemy~♪\n\nE-Err… Those all sound pretty amazing, but I don’t think I really need any those.\n\nI-Is that so… So I’m completely unnecessary…?\n\nNo, that’s not it! I’m not too familiar with ninja techniques, so when I was listening, I thought it sounded pretty amazing.\nI’m really glad you have something you want for yourself. ♪\nI’m sure Anzu-chan and Isara-kun would be happy just hearing you say you want to repay them for everything they do.\n\nDo you think so…? To be a ninja who isn’t put to use as a ninja… Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Still.\nIsara-dono calls upon me whenever he needs my strength, and so I’ll work harder to be someone Anzu-dono can rely on too.\n\n(What a relief. It looks like Shinobu-kun’s fired up.)\n\nChapter 4\n\nI’m back~\n\nAh, Nito-senpai. Welcome back.\n\nChairman-dono! As you can see, we’ve held down the fort. The broadcast studio is safe and sound~!\n\n…\n\nChairman-dono?\n\nS-Sorry, sorry. Just thinking about something.\n… I said I&#39;d take it on, but can we move things around…? No, we absolutely can’t do that…?\n\nNito-senpai, is something wrong?\n\nSagami-sensei called me to tell me Ra*bits had work.\nSo the problem is I’ll have to be out all day tomorrow. I’m worried about managing it.\n\nPlease don’t worry about us and put your full, undivided attention on your work, Chairman-dono!\nWe can’t rely on you forever! I’ll prove to you I can completely do it on my own~♪\n\nWhoaa, Shinobun’s motivated~♪ But I’m still a little nervous, so Mako-chin. Could you be Shinobun’s backup?\n\nPlease leave it to us! I won’t say it’s going to be a complete breeze, but… the two of us will do our best!\n\nAlrighty. It’s in your hands.\n\nFrom here on out, I’ll have to do my best as the next chairman, then. I’ll make sure to lead Shinobu-kun too.\n\nYou’re so reliable, Mako-chin~♪ We haven’t decided you’re gonna be the next chairman yet, though.\nEhhh…? That’s pretty cruel to say when I’m so fired up~?\nMm-hmm. Ni~chan is touched to have such splendid juniors.\nNow, then, I might go ask Sagami-sensei about tomorrow. You guys, don&#39;t stay too long, ‘kay? Promise Ni~chan☆\n\n… He left just like that.\n\n\nWell, first things first, we have a broadcast tomorrow afternoon at lunch. Is the script done?\n\nDone and done ☆ We just haven’t decided on what songs to play yet.\n\nWell, how about we go to the shopping district and pick some out?\nThere&#39;s this one store I’d recommend. It&#39;s got pretty good prices and a huge variety, so you should be able to find songs you like, Shinobu-kun.\n\nSeriously!? B-But, is it really okay to go together…?\nNinjas are destined to live and die in the darkness, after all. I’m not the kind of character that does something like go shopping~ with a senior.\n\nWe’re in the same committee, but we haven’t had the chance to talk much. I thought this might be a good opportunity to get to know each other better.\n\nG-Get to know me better…? Does that mean I’m rising up the ranks of friendship!?\n\nHm? I think so. Does that mean we weren’t friends up to now…?\n\nI don’t have any friends, so to be honest, I’ve felt pretty lonely. But recently, I’ve started to make more little by little. I’m really happy ♪\nCome now, Yuuki-dono, let’s go~♪\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ The pun here is やっぱり今期も根気のいる作業は大事ってことだね; 今期 (konki; this term) and 根気 (konki; perserverance) are homonyms.

All done reinforcing the barricade ☆\n\nGood, it looks wonderful. It&#39;s much more formidable. It won&#39;t be breached so easily now.\nYou seem very skilled at this. Is building barriers— &quot;barri-kedo&quot;— your specialty?\n\nNo. I just kinda went with what felt right~ and tossed it together like this.\nStill, pretty good for a first try, dontcha think? I feel so accomplished...☆\n\n— This is no time to relax, though. Let&#39;s stay vigilant and keep our guards up, Zaki-san!\n\nRight. We&#39;ll show them that we can hold them back successfully.\n\n“One~ two~ Mic test, mic test.”\n\nThat voice… It seems that they are planning to try out a new plan.\n\nThis &quot;barri-kedo&quot; is the embodiment of my conviction... Even if it&#39;s Isara-dono who stands against me, it will never crumble!\n\nOop, it got too loud. I&#39;m sure the staff room could hear it all the way down there.\n\nThe sound carries real well in this hallway, huh~ Maybe I just need to adjust it a little.\n\n— Isara-senpai. Doesn&#39;t look like the situation&#39;s gotten any more resolved, huh?\nWhat&#39;s that you&#39;re holding in your hand? It looks like a trumpet.\n\nHm? Ahh, Amagi. You&#39;ve never seen a megaphone before? Well, I guess it&#39;s not the kind of thing you&#39;d use every day either.\n\nThis is a megaphone. It&#39;s a machine that makes your voice go farther... Does that make sense? Well, just think of it like a microphone.\nUnlike a microphone, though, a megaphone has a built-in speaker. It&#39;s really handy in times like this.\n\n(Yeah. Times like this, when there&#39;s a barricade, or a castle&#39;s under siege or something...)\n\n\n&quot;Ahem~ Third Year from Class A, Akehoshi Subaru! Third Year from Class B, Kanzaki Souma!&quot;\n&quot;We have you completely surrounded! Resistence is pointless, come out with your hands up!&quot;\n\nLiar~! There's no way you've got us surrounded! The only voices we can hear are yours and Hiiro's, Sally~!\nHow pathetic! You can&#39;t deceive us with that drivel like that, Isara-dono!\nSurrender? To do so would go against the very oath I&#39;ve given this sword!\n\nI knew he wouldn&#39;t be one to back down easy, but an oath to a sword of all things...\n(Sigh) Why did things get this troublesome...?\n\n\n    Location: Dojo\n\n\n\n    Several hours before.\n\n798! 799!\nE— Eight hundred…!\n(Two hundred left. A practice swing is still a swing. It&#39;s basic fundamental training— that makes it vital.)\n(It is not just about the repetitions, but giving every swing my full effort. That&#39;s how you get stronger than you were yesterday.)\n\nEn garde…! 1\n\n— Mm. What splendid swordsmaship.\n\nWh— Who goes there!\n\nOop. I’m sorry for surprising you. I’m Amagi Hiiro.\n\nAmagi? You, are you well-versed in the art of swordsmanship?\n\nI dabble, but not as much as you do, Kanzaki-senpai. If we&#39;re talking about martial arts though, my specialty is Amaterasu&#39;s Divine Fist.2\n\nAmaterasu&#39;s Divine... Fist?\n\nLooks like you don’t really know what that kind of thing is either, huh, Kanzaki-senpai. Well, it’s a martial art that everyone from my hometown knows.\n\nOh? I’ve never heard of it before, it&#39;s piqued my interest. Would it be alright if you showed me the movements you use for it?\n\nOf course. I&#39;d like to spar with you while we&#39;re at it. Just watching isn&#39;t enough to get the essence of it, I think.\n\nI see. Well, then, let me get set up. Give me one moment.\n\nOh, you don&#39;t need to put away your sword. I&#39;ll go against your sword with my fists, Kanzaki-senpai.\n\nIt&#39;s a mixed-martial art? How interesting. I feel as if I&#39;ll have the upper hand using a weapon, though.\n\nTo be honest, I wonder. I haven&#39;t completely figured out how strong you truly are, Senpai, so we won&#39;t know until we fight, right?\nI won&#39;t take it easy on you. Is that fine?\n\nHeheh, that&#39;s all I could ask for. It makes me want to respond with my dearest sword, but—\nIt would be a serious problem if by some chance you were to get hurt, so I&#39;ll use a wooden sword for this.\n\nLet us have a fair fight, to determine the victor then...!\nTake that!\n\n...\n\nHa! There! ... En garde! 1\n\n(&quot;En garde&quot;? What a strange shout of encouragment.)\n(Kanzaki-senpai is just like Buchou, talking while he&#39;s fighting. I wonder if this is how they do things in the city?)\n\nTake that!\n\n(... He handles his sword wonderfully. I wish the swordsmasters back home could see this.)\n\n(Wait, no. I got so focused on observing him, I&#39;ve gone on the defensive. At the next opportunity, I&#39;ll—)\n\nTake thaaat!\n\n— A weak point!\n\nHow&#39;s that? My eyes are getting adjusted to the way you move, Amagi.\n\nThis much is just a warm-up to me.\nMy body&#39;ll get going any second now! — Hah!\n\nO~i, Kanzaki! Are you there~?\n— What the. Oi, oi, what’s going on here? Is this a fight?\n\nOhh, Isara-dono. We were just sparring to show each other our respective crafts.\n\nYeah. It’s a lot of fun, you should join us too Isara-senpai!\n\nNono. That sorta thing isn’t my strong suit, so…\nHaha. You two are way too calm sparring while talking, huh.\n\nStill, it&#39;s such astonishing intensity. I see why there&#39;s been complaints, with stuff like this...\n\nHm? Complaints?\n\nChapter 2\n\n    Location: Dojo\n\n\n— Let&#39;s pause, Amagi. I call a truce.\nWhat &quot;complaints&quot;, Isara-dono? Do they have to do with me, by any chance?\n\nAhh, yeah. The truth is...\nIt was a complaint from one of the first years about the sword you wear. They were worried about whether they were going to be slashed, passing by you.\n\nSlashed? Kanzaki-senpai?\n\nThere&#39;s nothing for them to be worried about. I don&#39;t attack people indiscriminately.\n\nI know that, you&#39;re a really kind person, Kanzaki.\nBut that&#39;s just because I know how you are. Those guys don&#39;t, so it makes it scary to them.\nIt&#39;s not like I don&#39;t understand how they feel, either. In this era, you don&#39;t see people walking around carrying swords every day.\n\nIs that so? In my hometown, it&#39;s pretty typical.\n\nReally...? M~nn, well I guess I&#39;ll correct that— in the city, you don&#39;t see people walking around carrying swords every day.\n\nAnyways. If complaints come in, it&#39;s my responsibility to deal with them.\nWhen you come to school, how about you just leave your sword in the Student Councilroom for safekeeping?\n\n... Fine, I leave this in your care.\n\nWhat the. This short sword&#39;s...\n\nIt is a wakizashi. I cannot hand over my cherished sword to someone else, so I&#39;d like to make a deal with you; let this one take its place.\n\nI mean, you&#39;re saying that, but... Sorry, that&#39;s just not going to happen. Please hand over that sword.\n\nNo. Even if it&#39;s Isara-dono who stands against me, that is not going to happen.\nThis cherished sword has been passed down through my family from generation to generation. I was told to always wear it and never let it leave my side.\n\nI get that. It only has to be during school hours, so—\n\nYou do not get it, Isara-dono! This sword is my lifeforce!\nI have government authorization to wear this sword, and when Hasumi-dono was in the student council, he allowed it!\nSo, why!? Why are you trying to take it from me!?\n\nWell, I...— As the Student Council President, it&#39;s my duty for the sake of the student body to—\n\n\nI am part of the student body too! And I will never hand over this sword!\n\nWait!? Hold it, Kanzaki!\n\n\n    Location: Hallway\n\n\n(Panting)...\n(... The sound of Isara-dono&#39;s footsteps have stopped. It seems I&#39;ve finally shaken him off my trail.)\n\n(But what should I do from here? The academy is small, so there aren&#39;t many places to hide.)\n(And even if I make it to the end of the day, what about tomorrow? And the day after that? Will I have to be on the run for the rest of my life...?)\n\nOh, I spy with my little eye... Zaki-san~! Ya-ho, ya-ho~☆\nAkehoshi-dono...\n\nWhat&#39;re you doing here~ .. Hm? Are you okay? You don&#39;t look so good.\nOh, are you sick or something? Shouldn&#39;t we get you to the infirmary to rest?\n\nI see. If I were in an infirmary bed, it would be quite hard to notice me.\n\nBut we are pretty far from the infirmary, Isara-dono might catch us on the way.\n\nCatch you...? So... maybe you&#39;re playing tag with Sally~ then?\n\nAh, man... if you were gonna play, you should've invited me, y'know~ I wanna play tag too! Count me in, count me in~☆\nMn. I am not running away because I am playing a game. I&#39;m running for my life.\n\nRunning for your life? That sounds like a pretty big deal, doesn&#39;t it~\n\nI&#39;m not exaggerating, it&#39;s the absolute truth. There have been complaints from some first year students, so Isara-dono wants to confiscate this sword.\nThis sword is important, it has been passed down in my family for generations. I absolutely cannot hand it over.\n\nEh~ Taking Zaki-san&#39;s sword... that&#39;s so cruel! A Zaki-san without his sword is like a Gami-san without his guitar!\n\nLeave it to me! I&#39;m gonna let Sally really have it~!\n\nHold on, Akehoshi-dono. I&#39;m thankful for your feelings, but you won&#39;t get the result you&#39;re hoping for. I attempted to persuade him myself, but he wasn&#39;t open whatsoever.\n\nThat is why I have to be on the run, but... I still haven&#39;t quite figured out a place to hide.\n\nGot~cha... You&#39;re on the run, huh...?\n\n... Okay, I thought it through and came up with something good ♪ Zaki-san, over here!\n\nWhat&#39;s over there?\n\nDon&#39;t worry about it! Quickly, quickly, follow me ☆\n\n\n    Location: Classroom\n\n\nWe're here~☆ I didn't know if Sally~ would find us on our way, my heart was going crazy! Just getting here made me tired.\n(Hmm, it couldn&#39;t be, hiding in a classroom... surely, we&#39;ll get caught like this right away, but...)\n(There are plenty of classrooms. Thinking about the time it would take to search them one by one, this might be a way to buy us some time...?)\n\nO~i, Zaki-san. Come help me move the desks.\n\nThe desks? What on earth are we going to do with the desks?\n\nHeheh. It&#39;s a siege, baby. S-I-E-G-E ♪\n\nI saw this in a school drama once, all the students build a barricade up at the entrance to the classroom in order to stand up against the evil headmaster.\nIt tried to get breached over and over, but the students joined forces and drove them all away, and eventually the headmaster surrendered.\nThe feeling of all of them working as hard as they could was totally &quot;springtime of youth&quot; vibes. It was super-duper sparkly! ☆\n\nHmm... They say that you need three times as many troops to siege a castle than to defend it.\nIt might be a better plan than brazenly running around from place to place, where they could be lying in wait.\n\nBingo! Let&#39;s make an unstoppable barricade, and protect that sword from Sally~ One, two— go team! ☆\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTranslation Notes\n↑ ちぇすと (chesuto or chesto), an exclamation Souma gives when he lunges with his sword.
