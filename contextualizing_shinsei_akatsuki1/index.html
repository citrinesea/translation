Disposition. To do so, this post will explore Shinsei AKATSUKI and Ibuki through the lens of Japanese history, specifically the Meiji Restoration.</p><p>Happy Elements is no stranger to mishandling racial minorities. Adonis’s character is a clear example of orientalism, where he is defined by a generic Middle-Eastern aesthetic, and portrayed as either an exotic figure or threatening foreigner. Hiiro, who is strongly inferred to be Ainu, is frequently portrayed as an ignorant person from “the country” who must absorb the ways of “the city”. At times, his ignorance of modern society is treated as a source of humor.</p><p>With the addition of Ibuki (a canonically Ryukyuan character) to AKATSUKI, it's important to examine the Shinsei AKATSUKI storyline through the lens of Ryukyuan history. To do so, this analysis will break down plots and themes into three key historical parallels:</p><ul><li>Globalization. How Ibuki's American identity represents the "Black Ships" that forced Japan to modernize, and why AKATSUKI brings him in to survive in the modern era.</li><li>The Ryukyu Disposition. How Ibuki's Okinawan identity and his search for true Japanese-style have problematic implications, given the real-world annexation and assimilation of the Ryukyu Kingdom.</li><li>Militarization. How Ibuki's role in the “war unit” AKATSUKI contains parallels to the forced conscription and sacrifice of Okinawans in World War II.</li></ul><p>My goal is to create a clear resource for readers new to this history and to provide context for future translations, translation notes and discussions on this site.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Blue flashcards contain additional context.

Because of its location in the East China Sea, Ryukyu developed a unique culture and maritime empire through active trade with China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The kingdom maintained a tributary relationship with China before it was invaded by Satsuma of Japan in 1609. From then on, Ryukyu had a three-pronged political status: tributary state, vassal and kingdom. This lasted until 1879 when Japan formally annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom, dissolved its monarchy, and incorporated the islands as the Okinawa Prefecture. This marked the beginning of assimilation policies and erasure of Ryukyuan identity into the 20th century.</p></div><hr class="section-divider"><div class="content-card"><h2 class="section-header">The Many Meanings of Wa</h2><div class="section-summary"><strong>Section Summary:</strong> 和 (wa) means both "harmony" (or social cooperation) and "Japaneseness" (as a cultural identity). During the Meiji Restoration, this concept was weaponized to justify assimilation policies enforced on colonized nations.</div><p>The concept of 和 (wa) is what is key in this analysis, but it brings a complex history with it. To understand the historical parallels with Shinsei AKATSUKI, 和 (wa) must have its modern social meaning distinguished first, before we apply it to its role as a political tool during the Meiji Restoration. This distinction is important to highlight; while its core meaning holds different connotations to Japanese people in today’s society, the Meiji Restoration’s co-opted use of 和 (wa) is what applies when we analyze Shinsei AKATSUKI under the lens of the Ryukyu Disposition.</p><p><b>Social Harmony</b></p><div class="essay-quote"><i>"Harmony should be valued and quarrels should be avoided. Everyone has his biases, and few men are far-sighted. Therefore some disobey their lords and fathers and keep up feuds with their neighbors. <b>But when the superiors are in harmony with each other and the inferiors are friendly, then affairs are discussed quietly and the right view of matters prevails.</b>"</i><br>The Constitution of Prince Shotoku.</div><p>The primary definition of 和 (wa) is “harmony”. In modern Japanese society, 和 (wa) is a daily, foundational principle of social harmony, where different individuals achieve balance by contributing their strengths, without losing their individual character. 和 (wa) is a social contract, where the needs of the group are seen as more important than the needs of the individual, and a good citizen is someone who separate their true feelings from the their public facade to contribute to this overall 和 (wa).</p><p>和 (wa) can take many forms: it can be empathy and taking care of each other’s needs. It can be social etiquette, like staying quiet on a train or public space, or cleaning up after yourself. It can also be a hinderance: 和 (wa) can be acting passive in order to avoid conflict, or keeping expectations unspoken.</p><p><b>Japaneseness</b><br>The second definition of 和 (wa) is “Japaneseness”. Wa” is the oldest known term for Japan, first used by China and Korea. The original character 倭 (wa, submissive, dwarf) was derogatory. In the 8th century, Japan replaced the character 倭 with a new one to redefine its image: 和 (wa) (wa, harmony, peace). 和 (wa) is used in words associated with traditional Japanese culture, like 和風 (wafu, Japanese-style), 和食 (washoku, Japanese cuisine), and 和服 (wafuku, Japanese clothing).</p><p><b>Click the cards below to learn more information.</b></p><div class="tab"><button class="tablinks" onclick='openCity(event,"Majimun")'>End of the Tokugawa Shogunate (pre-1853)</button> <button class="tablinks" onclick='openCity(event,"Ibuki")'>Mechanisms of the Meiji Restoration (post-1853)</button></div><div id="Majimun" class="tabcontent"><div class="facts-container"><div class="flip-card" onclick='this.classList.toggle("flipped")'><div class="flip-card-inner"><div class="flip-card-front"><div class="tag">Historical Context</div><div class="title">Shogunate</div><div class="subtitle"></div></div><div class="flip-card-back"><b>Shogunate.</b><p>After the Great Unification, power was consolidated under the Tokugawa shogunate, a military government, while the emperor was made into a powerless figurehead.

This came after the United States settled on the western coastline after the Mexican-American war, because it set its sights on Japan as a fueling site for merchant ships. Prior to the Arrival of the Black Ships, Japan had watched China lose to the British in the Opium Wars, whose technology far surpassed theirs. While they had feared losing to foreign powers, the Americans outpaced them anyway and forced them to open their doors. After signing treaties with the United States and other Western Powers, Japan’s closed country policy ended.</p><p>The shogunate’s inability to prevent this foreign power from imposing its will exposed Japan’s vulnerabilities. After the arrival of the United States, Japan adopted Western institutions and structures to modernize and protect itself. A faction of lower-class samurai, lords and court nobles overthrew the shogunate, and consolidated power under the Meiji Emperor and Edo, which was then renamed to Tokyo. The period of Westerization, political upheaval and advancements that followed was the Meiji Restorationn.</p><p>In order to expand its imperial reach, Japan developed two strategies: making a modern military and creating a unifying national identity. While Japan used Western tools to strengthen itself, it wanted to keep its Japanese identity intact too. This identity would be founded around the concept of 和 (wa). In this case, the &quot;greater good&quot; that people were expected to contribute to was explicitly defined as the Emperor and the Yamato Japanese.</p><p>This philosophy of national unity was used to justify the assimilation of minority groups. Where 和 (wa) is defined as putting aside your wants and needs for the greater good, it was pushed onto the groups Japan conquered, where those “wants and needs” were groups’ autonomy, cultures and rights. Through various assimilation policies, the distinct languages, cultures, and traditions of the Ainu, Koreans, Taiwanese and Ryukyuans were systematically suppressed in favor of becoming Yamato Japanese. In other words, this “harmonious blending” of 和 (wa) was in actuality cultural erasure.</p><div class="historical-context"><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Assimilation policies included the 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act, the forced adoption of Japanese names in Korea and the compulsory use of Tokyo-Japanese language throughout new territories</div></div><div class="content-card"><h2 style="font-size:1.8em;border-bottom:2px solid #3498db;padding-bottom:8px">The Black Ships: The Embrace of Ibuki’s Western Identity</h2><div class="section-summary"><b>Section Summary</b>: Ibuki and Keito's first meeting mirrors Western global influence arriving in Japan and challenging the Japanese status quo. Conversely, the motivations behind Ibuki being invited to join AKATSUKI resemble the strategic Westernization Japan undertook to protect its sovreignity and identity.</div><p>Ibuki, AKATSUKI and the Legend of KAGETSU take place around the same time as Nice Arneb Thunder coming from abroad and bringing the MEGASPHERE with him. This timing creates a direct parallel to the Meiji Restoration, where global influence challenges the status quo and Japan takes on foreign principles to modernize and survive. Although Nice is not directly connected to Ibuki and AKATSUKI after Ibuki turns his offer down, their stories mirror the same parallel.</p><div class="key-insight"><strong>Key Point:</strong> Several stories make explicit connections to Commodore Perry's arrival through dialogue and themes. Eichi refers to Nice and Thunderbolt Entertainment as the 黒船の来航 (Kurofune no Raikou; The Black Ships). Nice explains his motivations of terraforming the Japanese idol world. Ibuki expresses a kinship to the MEGASPHERE, Nice's literal ship.</div><p>In the story, Nice is treated as Commodore Perry, bringing techonology, a new unit, and global idol culture to ES from overseas. Thematically, Nice's Black Ships are MELLOW DEAR US, the MEGASPHERE and Ibuki.</p><p>In the Audition Arc, Nice reveals to Seiya that bringing in MELLOW DEAR US (an overseas idol unit) is part of his plan to shake things around and reset the idol scene.

By integrating Ibuki into AKATSUKI, Keito can keep its core identity, while adapting and expanding it to stay independent and survive outside pressure in the future. However, when Keito talks about being an equal partner with Ibuki, or taking on his &quot;harmony&quot; (和), he's mainly discussing the interplay between the Japanese 和 (wa) and Ibuki's American identity. This makes it a cultural negotiation between two major powers (Japan and the United States), a reflection of the events that occurred during the Meiji Restoration.</p><p>There's a major clash in the story between low-context American culture (saying what you want, making deals, clearly stating expectations) and high-context Japanese culture (leaving things unsaid, implying meaning through the way you act, relying on unspoken expectations). Throughout the story, Ibuki learns Japanese-style high-context behavior (such as withholding information to protect AKATSUKI), while Keito learns American-style low-context communication (being direct, assertive, and rebellious when protecting AKATSUKI). However, Keito does not fully Americanize AKATSUKI: he cherry-picks Ibuki's directness and innovation as tools to protect AKATSUKI's new definition of 和 (wa), mirroring Japan's &quot;Western technology, Japanese spirit&quot; approach.</p><div class="translation-label"><b>Translation X.</b> Nice and Seiya discussing MELLOW DEAR US<br>VS AUDIENCE Influence 5, citrinesea</div><div class="translation-background2"><div class="msr-unit" character="Ibuki"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>♪~♪~♪</p><p>(Nyahaha.

AKATSUKI’s modernization is powered by Western influence as they take on Ibuki’s American way of thinking, while it protects its core Japanese identity. This leaves Ibuki as the one taking on Japanese-style high-context behavior. This imbalance is what parallels the Ryukyu Disposition.</p><div class="key-insight"><strong>Key Point:</strong> The narrative treats Ibuki's American traits as a transformative change for AKATSUKI. Ibuki's Ryukyuan traits are not transformative, but act as an existing "subset" of Japaneseness.</div><p>I'd like to illustrate the new 和 (wa) Keito talks about as a container that holds existing elements and can accommodate new ones. The table below explores the intersectionality of Ibuki's identity and illustrates how each of the three identities (Japanese, American, and Ryukyuan) contributes to or is constrained within that container.</p><table><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Keito (Mainland Japanese)</th><th>Ibuki (American)</th><th>Ibuki (Ryukyuan)</th></tr><tr><td>Handling the Container of 和</td><td>A container Keito owns and monitors, deciding what gets poured into it.</td><td>A container Ibuki pours into and contributes to.</td><td>A container Ibuki lives within.</td></tr><tr><td>Ability to Shape 和</td><td>Keito has the authority to define and change the characteristics of 和.</td><td>Ibuki introduces 和 from an American perspective, but it’s still within the limits defined by Keito.</td><td>Ibuki absorbs existing 和, with no current indication of reshaping it. Instead, his indigenous characteristics are now considered 和 under AKATSUKI.</td></tr><tr><td>Cultural Contribution They Provide</td><td>Keito redefines the traditional social harmony 和 he's upheld to include hunger and ambition.</td><td>Ibuki's directness, rebellion, assertiveness is valued in pushing AKATSUKI forward.</td><td>Ibuki's language and culture is acknowledged, but it’s nonstructural for AKATSUKI.</td></tr><tr><td>Narrative Function</td><td>Keito represents Japan's evolving image: modernization without losing its identity.</td><td>Ibuki represents cultural exchange with America: useful, equal, inspirational.</td><td>Ibuki represents cultural decoration: his unique background is present, but it doesn't challenge the dominant cultural identity. Instead, it is presented as a “subset” of it.</td></tr><tr><td>Colonial Dynamics</td><td>Keito embodies the colonializer that absorbs cultural differences without being entirely redefined by it.</td><td>The cultural exchange is equal, as American is another major power, fitting in a dominant cultural framework.</td><td>Ibuki embodies the colonized, included symbolically without providing structural change to the dominant culture.</td></tr></table><p>While Ibuki’s Ryukyuan identity is clearly displayed and demonstrated, it exists in a framework that doesn't allow it to reshape AKATSUKI's core identity. Right now, Ibuki contributes to AKATSUKI, but through his American identity, not his Ryukyuan one. Keito offers inclusion and an equal partnership, but it is on behalf of a competing major power at best (Japanese vs. American) and an assimilation approach at worst (Japanese vs. Ryukyuan); these are both reminiscent of the Meiji Restoration and its events.</p><p>Does a colonizer have the right to repurpose or glorify the concept of 和 (wa), a concept that has historically been used to assimilate groups like the Ryukyuans? And what’s being made inclusive in this scene isn’t the marginalized Ryukyuan identity, but another dominant culture, the United States. Phrasing it like &quot;fitting just right&quot; and &quot;blending in&quot; have overt connotations of assimilation.</p><h3 class="subsection-header">The Ryukyu Disposition</h3><div class="modern-connection"><strong>Note:</strong> Present-day Okinawans' relationship with Japanese identity is very complex and varies by person, diaspora and generation.

The primary reason Japan annexed the Ryukyus was to prevent outside militaries from occupying the islands, which were extremely close to the mainland.

Instead of promoting Western modernity, Okinawa was insulated and pushed toward adopting Japanese norms as the new ideal. Japanese clothing was labeled as “normal clothes,” and the language became the “national language.” These deliberate communication strategies worked to present Japanese customs as natural and standard, not foreign, and something Okinawa should seamlessly adopt. This too was a loyalty measure meant to keep outside Western influences away from Okinawa: while Japan used Western adaptations to strengthen itself, it also aimed to make Okinawa more Japanese, secure it beneath Japanese control. Therefore, they excluded the region from Westernization and insulated it. Together with the education-based measures in schools, these frames made it appear as if Okinawa and Japan had always been one and the same.[^]</p><p>Despite these measures, Japan did not functionally treat Okinawa as an equal. The prejudices from the Japanese who were anti-disposition carried into the way Okinawans were treated; they were viewed as barbaric, backward, and culturally inferior. The Okinawan economy was underdeveloped as they relied on imports for food, and by the 1920s, it lagged behind the mainland in infrastructure, healthcare, education, and industry. [^] During the major recession post-WWII, mainland Japan funneled Okinawa’s money into itself, crippling it further.</p><h3 class="subsection-header">Facing Assimilation</h3><p>The Ryukyu Disposition created a dilemma for the Ryukyuan people. Maintaining their distinct language and customs led to marginalization and discrimination. On the other hand, assimilating and adopting Japanese language and identity was perceived as the only path toward economic opportunity, suffrage, and social acceptance under the Japanese system. This forced choice between survival and cultural integrity led many Okinawans to advocate for &quot;defensive assimilation&quot;</p><div class="historical-context"><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Many Okinawans gave into assimilation NOT as acceptance of Japanese superiority, but as a coerced survival strategy within a discriminatory system. In doing so, they hoped to prevent more aggressive policies and earn equal rights other prefectures had.</div><p>In response, many Okinawan leaders demanded the same rights as other Japanese prefectures and sought to prove their loyalty through assimilation. This is not to say Ryukyuans blindly accepted assimilation: they criticized Japan's slow reforms, unequal treatment, and disregard for Ryukyuan heritage. However, pursuing equality and representation meant navigating a difficult trade-off. It is critical to understand that this assimilation was a coerced strategy for survival within an oppressive, discriminatory system, not acceptance of the situation. They hoped to prevent more aggressive assimilationist policies and earn the rights other prefectures had.</p><p>Scholars like Ifa Fuyu (an Okinawan scholar, known as the father of Okinawan studies) created theories to justify absorption into Japan while building Ryukyuan self-esteem. Ifa's Common Ancestry Theory argued that the Japanese and Okinawan people were &quot;brothers&quot; from the same ancient roots, based off of language and cultural similarities. For Ifa, this theory was meant to fight discrimination by proving that Okinawans were equals who shared a noble history with the Japanese, and thus deserved equal status, respect, and treatment. However, the Japanese government also used it to justify taking over Okinawa and forcing its people to assimilate, arguing they were just reuniting a family. The result of these assimilation pressures led to the phasing out of Ryukyuan practices, language, and customs, many of which are endangered today.</p><p>I point again to Prince Shotoku's quote:</p><div class="essay-quote"><i>"<b>Harmony should be valued and quarrels should be avoided.</b> Everyone has his biases, and few men are far-sighted. Therefore some disobey their lords and fathers and keep up feuds with their neighbors. <b>But when the superiors are in harmony with each other and the inferiors are friendly, then affairs are discussed quietly and the right view of matters prevails.</b>"</i><br>The Constitution of Prince Shotoku.</div><p>Ifa's motivation was to navigate a path that avoided open conflict. This is a very a clear illustration of abiding by the social harmony of wa.</p><div class="modern-connection"><strong>Note:</strong> We mention and examine Ifa Fuyu's use of Common Ancestry Theory NOT as a valid model, but as an example of how cultural defense can coexist with and even enforce the assimilation it seeks to resist. Likewise, the validation of Ibuki's Ryukyuan identity does not negate the assimilationist parallels of his existence in AKATSUKI. We will unpack the issues with "true Japanese-style" using this theory as a lens next.</div><h3 class="subsection-header">Ibuki and his search for "true Japanese-style"</h3><div class="section-summary"><strong>Section Summary:</strong> Ibuki's search for "true Japanese-style" mirrors the problematic logic of historical assimilation, where Okinawan identity is only validated through conformity to mainland standards.

We currently can't be sure what his implication is here. However, if he is suggesting that the style is incomplete without his Okinawan perspective, it would align with Ifa Fuyu's assimilationist framework: Ryukyuan distinctness is only permitted inside the broader context of being Japanese.</p><div class="critical-analysis"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Ibuki's search for "true Japanese-style" reflects Ifa Fuyu's theory, where Ryukyuan identity and character exists within a Japan framework. This reinforces the assimilationist claim that Ryukyu has "always been Japanese".</div><p>Under Ifa Fuyu’s framework, the preservation of Ibuki’s Ryukyuan identity does not contradict his place in the Japanese-style AKATSUKI; to a pro-assimilationist like Ifa, Ibuki can be both distinctly Ryukyuan and fundamentally Japanese. Ifa’s common ancestry theory argued that because Ryukyuans share ancient roots with the Japanese, their culture is inherently Japanese. At the same time, he emphasized the distinct traits that made the Ryukyuan people special. Similarly, Ibuki’s background is acknowledged, but his Ryukyuan identity is confined within the bounds of being Japanese. His fascination with the Japanese aesthetic version of Ryukyuan symbols (e.g., the shiisaa and shishi) positions mainland interpretation as the desired standard. This ultimately frames Okinawa’s culture as something that exists to further prop up and affirm the mainland and national identity of Japan, not as its own independent entity. The goalpost of &quot;Japanese-ness&quot; is the ultimate validator, which can prevent Okinawan culture from being perceived as valuable on its own terms. In other words, it is a Japan-centric ideal that reaffirms the very policies of assimilation that absorbed and attempted to erase the Ryukyuans as something “truly Japanese”.</p><div class="critical-analysis"><strong>Analysis:</strong> By making Ibuki enthusiastically seek "true Japanese-style" without coercion, the narrative reframes assimilation as voluntary, erasing the actual power dynamics and survival pressures that were part of the Ryukyu Disposition.</div><p>However, what truly makes Ibuki's search for &quot;true Japanese-style&quot; even <em>more</em> ideologically problematic is that it is enthusiastic and uncoerced. While Ifa Fuyu, other scholars and Okinawans as a whole were responding to discrimination from a dominant power, and working to survive assimilation, Ibuki's search is unironically willful. This portrayal makes cultural absorption appear voluntary, rather than the imposing, coerciveness it really was. In doing so, it erases the colonial power dynamics that actually existed between Japan and Ryukyu.</p><h3 class="subsection-header">Conclusion</h3>I'll think about this While the story frequently acknowledges Ibuki's heritage, it once again sidesteps the coercive power dynamics of the Ryukyu Disposition by making his pursuit of "true Japanese-style" entirely voluntary and enthusiastic. Next, we will examine Shinsei AKATSUKI on a macro level as a military unit, and draw parallels to the conscription and sacrifice of Okinawans in the Battle of Okinawa.</div><hr class="section-divider"><div class="content-card"><h2 class="section-header">Cultural Hegemony</h2><p>Some kind of introduction sentence, something about fittig it all together. At the very core of the writing behind Shinsei AKATSUKI is a broad, systemic force: cultural hegemony.</p><p>Cultural hegemony is when the beliefs of the powerful group in society become so widespread that they are seen as &quot;common sense&quot; by everyone, making the existing social order seem normal and inevitable. These are ideas that are so &quot;common&quot;, most people don't think to question it (i.e., it's just the way things are). In the context of Shinsei AKATSUKI, the hegemonic belief is that &quot;Okinawa is and has always been a natural part of Japan.&quot; For many people now, Okinawan has always been a Japanese prefecture in their lifetime.</p></div></div><footer class="post-footer"></footer></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-inner"><div class="copyright">&copy; 2024 – <span itemprop="copyrightYear">2025</span> <span class="with-love"><i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i> </span><span class="author" itemprop="copyrightHolder">citrinesea</span></div></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animejs@3.2.1/lib/anime.min.js" integrity="sha256-XL2inqUJaslATFnHdJOi9GfQ60on8Wx1C2H8DYiN1xY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/translation/js/comments.js"></script><script src="/translation/js/utils.js"></script><script src="/translation/js/motion.js"></script><script src="/translation/js/next-boot.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hexo-generator-searchdb@1.4.0/dist/search.js" integrity="sha256-vXZMYLEqsROAXkEw93GGIvaB2ab+QW6w3+1ahD9nXXA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/translation/js/third-party/search/local-search.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quicklink@2.2.0/dist/quicklink.umd.js" integrity="sha256-4kQf9z5ntdQrzsBC3YSHnEz02Z9C1UeW/E9OgnvlzSY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script class="next-config" data-name="quicklink" type="application/json">{"enable":true,"home":true,"archive":false,"delay":true,"timeout":3000,"priority":true,"ignores":null,"url":"https://citrinesea.github.io/translation/contextualizing_shinsei_akatsuki1/"}</script><script src="/translation/js/third-party/quicklink.js"></script></body></html>
