To do so, this post will explore Shinsei AKATSUKI and Ibuki through the lens of Japanese history, specifically the Meiji Restoration.</p><p>Happy Elements is no stranger to mishandling racial minorities. Adonis’s character is a clear example of orientalism, where he is defined by a generic Middle-Eastern aesthetic, and portrayed as either an exotic figure or threatening foreigner. Hiiro, who is strongly inferred to be Ainu, is frequently portrayed as an ignorant person from “the country” who must absorb the ways of “the city”. At times, his ignorance of modern society is treated as a source of humor.</p><p>With the addition of Ibuki (a canonically Ryukyuan character) to AKATSUKI, it's important to examine the Shinsei AKATSUKI storyline through the lens of Ryukyuan history. To do so, this analysis will break down plots and themes into three key historical parallels:</p><p>⦿ Globalization. How Ibuki's American identity represents the &quot;Black Ships&quot; that forced Japan to modernize, and why AKATSUKI brings him in to survive in the modern era.<br>⦿ The Ryukyu Disposition. How Ibuki's Okinawan identity and his search for true Japanese-style have problematic implications, given the real-world annexation and assimilation of the Ryukyu Kingdom.<br>⦿ Militarization. How Ibuki's role in the “war unit” AKATSUKI contains parallels to the forced conscription and sacrifice of Okinawans in World War II.</p><p>My goal is to create a clear resource for readers new to this history and to provide context for future translations, translation notes and discussions on this site.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Blue flashcards contain additional context.

Because of its location in the East China Sea, Ryukyu developed a unique culture and maritime empire through active trade with China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The kingdom maintained a tributary relationship with China before it was invaded by Satsuma of Japan in 1609. From then on, Ryukyu had a three-pronged political status: tributary state, vassal and kingdom. This lasted until 1879 when Japan formally annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom, dissolved its monarchy, and incorporated the islands as the Okinawa Prefecture. This marked the beginning of assimilation policies and erasure of Ryukyuan identity into the 20th century.</p></div><hr class="section-divider"><div class="content-card"><h2 class="section-header">The Many Meanings of Wa</h2><div class="section-summary"><strong>Section Summary:</strong> 和 (wa) means both "harmony" (or social cooperation) and "Japaneseness" (as a cultural identity). During the Meiji Restoration, this concept was weaponized to justify assimilation policies enforced on colonized nations.</div><p>The concept of 和 is what is key in this analysis, but it brings a complex history with it. To understand the historical parallels with Shinsei AKATSUKI, 和 must have its modern social meaning distinguished first, before we apply it to its role as a political tool during the Meiji Restoration. This distinction is important to highlight; while its core meaning holds different connotations to Japanese people in today’s society, the Meiji Restoration’s co-opted use of 和 is what applies when we analyze Shinsei AKATSUKI under the lens of the Ryukyu Disposition.</p><p><b>Social Harmony</b></p><div class="essay-quote"><i>"Harmony should be valued and quarrels should be avoided. Everyone has his biases, and few men are far-sighted. Therefore some disobey their lords and fathers and keep up feuds with their neighbors. <b>But when the superiors are in harmony with each other and the inferiors are friendly, then affairs are discussed quietly and the right view of matters prevails.</b>"</i><br>The Constitution of Prince Shotoku.</div><p>The primary definition of 和 is “harmony”. In modern Japanese society, 和 is a daily, foundational principle of social harmony, where different individuals achieve balance by contributing their strengths, without losing their individual character. 和 is a social contract, where the needs of the group are seen as more important than the needs of the individual, and a good citizen is someone who separate their true feelings from the their public facade to contribute to this overall 和.</p><p>和 can take many forms: it can be empathy and taking care of each other’s needs. It can be social etiquette, like staying quiet on a train or public space, or cleaning up after yourself. It can also be a hinderance: 和 can be acting passive in order to avoid conflict, or keeping expectations unspoken.</p><p><b>Japaneseness</b><br>The second definition of 和 is “Japaneseness”. Wa” is the oldest known term for Japan, first used by China and Korea. The original character 倭 (wa, submissive, dwarf) was derogatory. In the 8th century, Japan replaced the character 倭 with a new one to redefine its image: 和 (wa, harmony, peace). 和 (wa) is used in words associated with traditional Japanese culture, like 和風 (wafu, Japanese-style), 和食 (washoku, Japanese cuisine), and 和服 (wafuku, Japanese clothing).</p><p><b>Click the cards below to learn more information.</b></p><div class="tab"><button class="tablinks" onclick='openCity(event,"Majimun")'>End of the Tokugawa Shogunate (pre-1853)</button> <button class="tablinks" onclick='openCity(event,"Ibuki")'>Mechanisms of the Meiji Restoration (post-1853)</button></div><div id="Majimun" class="tabcontent"><div class="facts-container"><div class="flip-card" onclick='this.classList.toggle("flipped")'><div class="flip-card-inner"><div class="flip-card-front"><div class="tag">Historical Context</div><div class="title">Shogunate</div><div class="subtitle"></div></div><div class="flip-card-back"><b>Shogunate.</b><p>After the Great Unification, power was consolidated under the Tokugawa shogunate, a military government, while the emperor was made into a powerless figurehead.

This came after the United States settled on the western coastline after the Mexican-American war, because it set its sights on Japan as a fueling site for merchant ships. Prior to the Arrival of the Black Ships, Japan had watched China lose to the British in the Opium Wars, whose technology far surpassed theirs. While they had feared losing to foreign powers, the Americans outpaced them anyway and forced them to open their doors. After signing treaties with the United States and other Western Powers, Japan’s closed country policy ended.</p><p>The shogunate’s inability to prevent this foreign power from imposing its will exposed Japan’s vulnerabilities. After the arrival of the United States, Japan adopted Western institutions and structures to modernize and protect itself. A faction of lower-class samurai, lords and court nobles overthrew the shogunate, and consolidated power under the Meiji Emperor and Edo, which was then renamed to Tokyo. The period of Westerization, political upheaval and advancements that followed was the Meiji Restorationn.</p><p>In order to expand its imperial reach, Japan developed two strategies: making a modern military and creating a unifying national identity. While Japan used Western tools to strengthen itself, it wanted to keep its Japanese identity intact too. This identity would be founded around the concept of 和 (wa). In this case, the &quot;greater good&quot; that people were expected to contribute to was explicitly defined as the Emperor and the Yamato Japanese.</p><p>This philosophy of national unity was used to justify the assimilation of minority groups. Where 和 (wa) is defined as putting aside your wants and needs for the greater good, it was pushed onto the groups Japan conquered, where those “wants and needs” were groups’ autonomy, cultures and rights. Through various assimilation policies, the distinct languages, cultures, and traditions of the Ainu, Koreans, Taiwanese and Ryukyuans were systematically suppressed in favor of becoming Yamato Japanese. In other words, this “harmonious blending” of 和 (wa) was in actuality cultural erasure.</p><div class="historical-context"><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Assimilation policies included the 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act, the forced adoption of Japanese names in Korea and the compulsory use of Tokyo-Japanese language throughout new territories</div></div><div class="content-card"><h2 style="font-size:1.8em;border-bottom:2px solid #3498db;padding-bottom:8px">The Black Ships: The Embrace of Ibuki’s Western Identity</h2><div class="section-summary"><b>Section Summary</b>: Ibuki and Keito's first meeting mirrors Western global influence arriving in Japan and challenging the Japanese status quo.

In the Legend of KAGETSU, Keito tells Rei that he has suspected that Rhythm Link wants to use AKATSUKI’s obedience and discipline to mold them into a convenient, controlled successor.

This is seen as Ibuki plays an arrangement of Hyakkaryoran, which combines his spin with the original Japanese-style song.

By integrating Ibuki into AKATSUKI, Keito can keep its core identity, while adapting and expanding it to stay independent and survive outside pressure in the future. However, when Keito talks about being an equal partner with Ibuki, or taking on his &quot;harmony&quot; (和), he's mainly discussing the interplay between the Japanese 和 and Ibuki's American identity. This makes it a cultural negotiation between two major powers (Japan and the United States), a reflection of the events that occurred during the Meiji Restoration.</p><p>There's a major clash in the story between low-context American culture (saying what you want, making deals, clearly stating expectations) and high-context Japanese culture (leaving things unsaid, implying meaning through the way you act, relying on unspoken expectations). Throughout the story, Ibuki learns Japanese-style high-context behavior (such as withholding information to protect AKATSUKI), while Keito learns American-style low-context communication (being direct, assertive, and rebellious when protecting AKATSUKI). However, Keito does not fully Americanize AKATSUKI: he cherry-picks Ibuki's directness and innovation as tools to protect AKATSUKI's new definition of 和, mirroring Japan's &quot;Western technology, Japanese spirit&quot; approach.</p><div class="translation-label"><b>Translation X.</b> Nice and Seiya discussing MELLOW DEAR US<br>VS AUDIENCE Influence 5, citrinesea</div><div class="translation-background2"><div class="msr-unit" character="Ibuki"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>♪~♪~♪</p><p>(Nyahaha.

Just as Japan adopted Western tools and ideals to strengthen itself against foreign threats, AKATSUKI integrates Ibuki's Western perspective to avoid stagnation. The narrative emphasizes strengthening traditional 和 (wa) while adapting with new cultural tools. While the story meaningfully engages with the American influence, it largely neglects and sidesteps Japan and Okinawa's complex assimilation history. We will unpack Ibuki's Ryukyuan background next.</p></div></div><footer class="post-footer"></footer></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-inner"><div class="copyright">&copy; 2024 – <span itemprop="copyrightYear">2025</span> <span class="with-love"><i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i> </span><span class="author" itemprop="copyrightHolder">citrinesea</span></div></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animejs@3.2.1/lib/anime.min.js" integrity="sha256-XL2inqUJaslATFnHdJOi9GfQ60on8Wx1C2H8DYiN1xY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/translation/js/comments.js"></script><script src="/translation/js/utils.js"></script><script src="/translation/js/motion.js"></script><script src="/translation/js/next-boot.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hexo-generator-searchdb@1.4.0/dist/search.js" integrity="sha256-vXZMYLEqsROAXkEw93GGIvaB2ab+QW6w3+1ahD9nXXA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/translation/js/third-party/search/local-search.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quicklink@2.2.0/dist/quicklink.umd.js" integrity="sha256-4kQf9z5ntdQrzsBC3YSHnEz02Z9C1UeW/E9OgnvlzSY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script class="next-config" data-name="quicklink" type="application/json">{"enable":true,"home":true,"archive":false,"delay":true,"timeout":3000,"priority":true,"ignores":null,"url":"https://citrinesea.github.io/translation/contextualizing_shinsei_akatsuki1/"}</script><script src="/translation/js/third-party/quicklink.js"></script></body></html>
